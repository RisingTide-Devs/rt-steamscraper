																Loved the original, and this updated version is just as good.The additions along the way are very nice, and the improved graphics are noticeable. Being able to converse with your partners whenever you want is also amazing.However...Was disappointed to have a few areas and puzzles removed. Since those were the more difficult parts of the original game, I assume this was done for a more streamlined experience. Instead of your flower wilting to represent your life, it is now replaced by more accurate "points". Although this makes it easier to tell exactly how many hits you can take, I miss the more original old design.An iconic music track was also changed, likely due to licensing issues... Can't completely replace the original for me, but it's still a very worthwhile experience! Still wishing for a sequel a decade later.

I still love this game so much, and still giving me the same comfy feelings of playing a chill RPG Maker game in a rainy afternoon11/10Perfect

One of the best indie horror jrpg of its time with improved graphics, new puzzles and nice little extras that make the experience even more enjoyable and more up to today's standards.Don't give your rose to a blonde little girl and everything should be fine I guess.

																Words honestly can't describe how much I just genuinely love this game. I remember when I first heard about it by watching PewDiePie play it back in 2012, and ever since then it's been my all time favorite RPG Maker game. I spent probably 200+ hours just replaying it over and over again, I have no idea what it was about Ib, but the kid me was just so in love with this game. I had the soundtrack on my PSP which I carried everywhere and listened to often, I replayed the game what had to have been at least over 100 times, and I was there for Every update. I remember when the Extra Dungeon update dropped and I was so excited, I had thought the game wasn't gonna be getting anything new, and there the Extra Dungeon update came in. I kept doing the steps to unlock the Dungeon wrong, and I ended up replaying the entire game 4 times in one day, Just to get to that Dungeon, because I wanted to play through it so bad. I had known about other RPG Maker games before, but Ib was the one that Really stood out to me, and got me into the rest. Ib is one of my biggest inspirations for wanting to make my own unique and bizarre games, and stories. There's just so much I could say about what this game has done for me, but I'm sure I'd run out of space to type, honestly. When I read that there was a Remake coming to Steam, I was beyond excited. If not for an excuse to replay the game once again, then for the fact that I'd get to hopefully see the game with some new ideas and changes that Kouri would have wanted to make to the game. It was all just so exciting to me. I bought it as soon as I could, and even though it's not in English yet, I still played through the game as best I could. When I couldn't use my memory to complete stuff, I would try my best to translate the dialogue into English. It was so much fun revisiting this game, the new artwork, new puzzles, new ideas, and just generally, everything about this remake warms my little heart, and brings such a big smile to my face. I imagine now that I've gotten back into this game, I'm gonna be replaying it over and over again, just like I did back in 2012-2015. What else can I say? This game holds the most special place in my heart, and it will always mean the world to me. I'm really grateful that this came to steam, and I'm honestly really grateful this remake happened at all! What a pleasant surprise. I'm just so uncontrollably happy, Thank you so much Kouri for making one of my most Favorite games of all time, I really hope to see more from you in the future, and I am extremely glad, and happy to see you still around. You're my hero! ^w^ ♥

																I played the original version of this game when I was young. Bought this mainly because of nostalgia and to support the dev. I still love this game. It's not the scariest horror themed game in the world, but in my opinion, it's one of the most beautiful, even among the RPG horror subgenre. If you can't, or don't want to buy this one, at least see if you can find the original. IDK if it's still up though. Either way, it's well worth it.

																This review was initially framed for veterans of IB who have played the original and want to know if the Steam version is worth the price over the original, as well as if this version is the definitive version of IB. I will also remark on if new players should buy this version at the end of the review over the free version. This review is a bullet-point list of things better, mixed, or worse compared to the free version. If you are a new player, you can skip just to the conclusion to avoid spoilers.Exceptionally better:-You can talk with Garry at any moment in almost every room (and with different dialogues depending on different location within the room, so a huge chunk of new dialogue). This is - by far - exceptional fan-service since one of the biggest draws for fans to buy an expanded version of games they've completed is to spend more time with characters they love, and you have that in spades with this version. Alongside Garry, Mary also has this expanded dialogue as well when she's in your party. -IB's dream (nightmare) sequence right after the end of the Grey Area is executed more artfully and a better and richer dream sequence overall.Better:-So much level streamlining, rooms that did not need to be rooms are deleted and some puzzles are streamlined on unnecessary aspects (6 tile pieces instead of 12). Not all of this is better, but quite a bit are an improvement.-Characters have better portraits, especially Mary who has a cute fang now when she's angry at you.-The top-down pixel art is better overall, but there is some minor inferiorities here and there (the blue dolls in the bunny room are slightly less intimidating than the free version)-True Exhibit picture tracking is streamlined across save files, so the game remembers which picture you've already seen not just from inside one single save-file line, but across all save files (as long as you saved).Mixed:-The puzzles overall. Quite a few puzzles have been replaced for completely new puzzles and many original puzzles that were kept were streamlined in some ways. On the whole, I personally felt the new puzzles are easier than the old puzzles, either more obvious or just less steps, and I don't like this. The new puzzles are not as interesting as the old ones, but they are more streamlined and less prone to getting new players stuck on a step, but I don't mind if the player gets stuck on a good puzzle because it's ultimately worth it. The whole vent-logic of the rainbow pallet area is replaced with some snake and vent orientation puzzle which is less imaginative and clever for me. Some players might prefer these slightly easier and more streamlined puzzles, but I don't.Worse:-Grey Area escalation sequence, the new version is a scripted linear maze where you flee from a single painting compared to the free version where it is utter chaos with every monster coming to life at the same time and you have absolutely no idea where you are going. In this new version, Garry immediately points you to the exit before the monster chases you so there is no uncertainty, but in the old version it's utter confusion and panic since you don't initially know where to go and everything has come alive trying to kill you. This new version is so inferior to the old version it blows my mind that Kouri removed it, this is one of the tensest moments of the original game and now it's nowhere near as tense or memorable.-Excessive puzzle hints. In certain areas, not all, there are too many hints to be gained from just talking to your companion character, whether it's Gary or Mary. You will have hints all the way through to the finish line, Kouri doesn't want any player to be left behind which is noble in some regard, but I see great value in letting players get stuck and having to push themselves to figure it out. By getting stuck, the puzzles become a bigger achievement since the players had to work harder for the solution, so hints that guide through the entire puzzle undermine the satisfaction in a real way. This doesn't always happen, but it does happen. -Music. Kouri switched around which tracks are played during which scenes (some not all), and also replaced some tracks with completely new songs. This was never done in a way that improved upon the original free version, there was not a single switch or new song that was better than the track and scene matching of the original, so it's just overall worse.-Rpgmaker Engine version. MV is a lot buggier than Rpgmaker 2000, so there will be a longer period of bug-crunching to make it as bug-free as the free version. I encountered a bug that forced me to restart the game once during my playthrough. There have been several patches now, so it should in theory be better.A lot worse:-Sound effects. I am so sad that the very aggressive "HWAA!!" that the red headless statue shouts at you when it comes alive is removed and replaced with silence. Really Kouri? Why? That sound effect alone establishes the danger and urgency for running away from the monster so strongly for the game, and you removed or changed this central aspect of tension not just from the first red statue, but also for the black hands coming out of the walls and the red lady as well. This dilutes the horror so much, it was central for establishing tension inside the initial monster encounters and how could you possibly remove this sound effect? I am baffled that Kouri who created the original IB is the same person who made this remake that doesn't see the value of these sound effects.Conclusion: Overall, if you are a big fan of IB and have played the free version many times before, just the fact that you have so many new lines of optional dialogue with Gary should alone be enough to make you purchase the Steam version so I can recommend it to veterans who love and are passionate about the original game. But is this the Definitive version of IB? I would say No it is not because the puzzles, while more streamlined, are less rewarding and imaginative than the original and more importantly, the horror is inferior to the free version because of some decisions of redesigning events as well as removing certain sound effects that set the tension. The Definitive version is still the freeware version 1.07.So for new players that have never played IB, the better experience is within the original free version so I recommend playing that over buying this. For veteran players, the game is worth it for the expanded time and dialogue with Gary and a nice trip down memory lane inside this beloved game. I would like to give a mixed review rather than a binary thumb up or down, but for the sake of new players I will thumb it down.

We were always discussing & trying to understand the ins-&-outs of the game and how to get a specific ending depending on what you did. Playing this brought me back to those good times in that library.The OSTs are nostalgic, the gameplay is about the same and the artwork is amazing as ever(actually the graphics are much better with this remake).The only complaint I have is that it lags at random times(though usually in the menu). The original IB on RPGMaker never did that.Overall I'm glad I bought this so I could support the Dev and thank them for all those years of entertainment-I just wish there wasn't so much lag over an RPGMaker game.

																Back then when I was a kid, I fall in love with Ib. And till this day I grew up, still fall in love with Ib.The horror elements are unique from different game for me atleast that is,The puzzle are wonderful and with added content it got much better,The story is beautiful that make my heart move,The music is also beautiful too the Ib theme, Prologue, etc are nice,The visual got better while still kinda maintain the dark vibe from the old game.I would say that this is a truly A Chef's Talent with a Place of Warmth in my heart that suck me into the Abyss of the Deep.I really love Ib. Yes, Ib. Not the game.

																As someone who has fond memories of playing the accessible version of Ib about ten years ago, I was over the moon once I heard it was released on Steam. This horror visual novel about Ib, a little girl caught in the illusion of a museum alongside Garry, surprised me with its engaging storyline and appealing characters.The game conjures an exciting world that one would very much like to explore, to unlock the said world's mysteries, and also to understand its history. Ib, Garry, and Mary themselves bring layers to the story, making each interaction meaningful and every session of solving the different puzzles satisfying. Even though the puzzles might prove somewhat problematic, they continue to balance not being too challenging to complete and allowing a good gameplay experience."Ib" is a game that is going subtle on horror: no sudden scares, no overpowering gore. Instead, it builds up that feeling of unease and fear as the story progresses. Creepy encounters with disturbing artwork and the strangeness of the museum keep players on edge without giving away cheap thrills.The Steam version of "Ib" is updated with several enhancements that make the overall gameplay experience better. With better graphics and dialogue screens, up to the ability to talk to the game's companions whenever you like, these editions help make the game more immersive and further aid one in building a stronger bond with the characters in the game. Sometimes, the puzzles change; generally, the changes favor better game mechanics, yet some classics may upset die-hard enthusiasts.This is a vital aspect of the game that raises feelings while it raises introspection. I had an episode of depression at that time, which brought many thoughts to the fore concerning love, loneliness, and time. The moving soundtrack, which I still listen to for inspiration, further added the depth of emotional experience while playing the game.In the end, "Ib" is more an artwork than a horror game; it resonates profoundly and stays beautifully created for the ones who get to partake in its enigma. Be you picking it back up again after years or new to the experience, this is a journey well worth taking, one that will stay with you long after you finish playing.Also, it might be a bit controversial, but I totally loved Mary as a character and the 'Together Forever' ending is definitely my favorite one <3

																I love this game with all my heart. I actually wrote this review before fully playing the remake—I had already bought the original Japanese version because I simply couldn’t wait to support this beautiful work of art. When I heard a remake was coming to Steam, I was beyond excited.From the bottom of my heart, thank you, Kouri. This game is sincere, touching, and visually and emotionally stunning. It speaks of love, loneliness, memories, emotional bonds, and so much more. If you decide to buy it, you won’t regret it—Ib is truly one of the most beautiful indie games out there.Honestly, words can’t express how much this game means to me. I first played it back in 2018 during a very difficult period in my life. I experienced it over three or four lonely nights, and it made me reflect deeply on my own journey. I played it twice and got the same ending both times—and both times I cried. It truly moved me.Since then, I’ve kept the entire soundtrack. I listen to it whenever I need inspiration, especially when I’m working on creative projects. I recommend this game with all my heart—Ib holds a special place in my memories and has had a real impact on my life. I know I’m not the only one who feels this way—Kouri, all of us here on Steam are happy to see you and support you. This is a true masterpiece. ♥Extra note: Ib was actually the main inspiration for my college thesis. I studied Visual Arts and created an educational video game about art history, with this beautiful game as my biggest reference.I haven’t finished the remake yet since it’s currently in Japanese, but I’ll update this review as soon as the English version is out.Thank you so much for reading!

																English the sooner the better. I found IB when I was just a kid through Cryaotic's channel and even though, it's been a while since I last played the original version of this game, it's still very near and dear to my heart.   It's a very sweet game and it's the one game that I asked my aunt to have on the computer when I was in her custody for a bit. I was that sure it'd be able to keep me entertained.

																Ib manages to do for me what so few horror games manage to accomplish, and that is to actually give a sense of unease and dread. Without going into spoilers, it's only a few minutes into the game that things start to tread the path of uncomfortable surrealism, with the art growing considerably more disturbing in how Ib interacts with it, and how the art interacts with her.With all due respect to more conventional horror titles, say, Dead Space or The Evil Within, Ib maintains a feeling of dread and discomfort. Enemies can be evaded, yes, but there's a feeling of being stalked while trapped in a world you can't possibly fully understand. Contrast Dead Space remake, where soon enough the horror gives way to cutting off an abomination's arm, then using telekinesis to impale it or another horror with said arm, then simply setting fire to the more mobile enemies.This is not, I repeat, not to disrespect games in which reducing enemies to a smoldering heap of charred body parts is an acceptable tactic- there is a time and a place for the cathartic destruction of the nightmares that haunted our closets and lurked under our beds. Ib, however, leans firmly towards the horror and self-preservation of being in a hostile and unknown environment, where the only feasible option is to run, hide, and hope whatever nameless horror eventually loses track of you.And let's face it- some modern art galleries are creepy enough already, even in the daylight.

																Beautiful game and I've fallen in love with it all over again. I played the original 2012 version and had forgotten about this game, only to then discover this remake. Is the price tag worth just the updates? No, not really. Is it worth both the entertainment and story of both the 2012 experience and the remake? Absolutely.I don't see the price tag as just buying the new content. I see it as my way of giving thanks to the creator for the memories over the years. Because of that, I feel this game is worth the price tag, even without a sale.

																Ib is an RPG maker game about a girl who visits an art museum with her family and ends up in another reality inside the paintings. The game itself has a compelling story and as a remake surpasses the original game. If you like playing RPG maker games, that involve lots of puzzles, wholesome storytelling, and slight hints of horror. I'd say it's your type of game and recommend it.

																How do I even go about reviewing this? Of all the rpgmaker titles in my library, from Ao Oni to Mad Father to The Witch's House to Corpse Party, The Crooked Man or even To The Moon, none have hit that level of being an absolute icon in the rpgmaker/indie horror fandom. Well, all those other ones are actually franchises more or less now, so I guess that claim is debatable. But Ib itself become the posterchild up there with the others for the big rpgmaker horror boom that took over gaming-YouTube circa 2012. And for good reason!The music, the characters, the aesthetics, the endings, all absolute classics looking back, which I was more than happy to relive 10 years later. It absolutely held up.Like other Steam versions of these games, these are remakes you pay for as opposed to the freeware we downloaded years ago. It has all the most recent content (including extra dungeons and endings that people who played before 1.04 may not have seen!) with updated graphics and UI, and quite honestly I am more than happy to pay this creator regardless.Exploring everything Ib can be a little headscratching at times. You'll want a guide handy to explore all the endings, or even just to get the best ending because the requirements for forming emotional bonds (or doom) with your party members can be pretty strict. And as a personal note, it's my opinion that the health meter is a little harder to read than in the original.That being said, save smartly, and you can see everything in 2-3 playthroughs and roughly 8 hours of playtime, going by my stats, roughly 2 hours per route. A short, sweet horror that people love to death as the little darling of the genre, and I am counted among them. I can't see myself not naming this as one of my favorite games at any point in the future, distant or not. Just... look at them beautiful pixels!

																I cannot praise Ib enough. I consider this to be a triumph of art and creativity, the very definition of breathing life and love into your work. To me, this is more than just a game with beautiful artwork, fun characters, and a spooky adventure through a mysterious wonderland. It wasn't created just to be observed and admired, but to take root and blossom inside the player. This is a living work of art that happily paints upon you while you play. It colors your soul, it draws on your heart, it doodles on your wishes and dreams. It is very playful, and it is always thrilled to be seen and enjoyed.

																A really good remake compared to the original, it feels much more full of stuff without it feeling like its strayed too far from its identity. One thing i really liked is how achieving a good ending isnt some weird complicated mess like it was in the original, that does mean the game is easier but i dont see that as a downside because the game is enjoyable for its experience and its unique atmosphere it brings. I had a lot of fun trying to inspect every art and dialogue piece garry had to say, the new higher res art allows for more detail while keeping its charm. The character portraits are awesome, except for the dad who looks very odd? but everything else is amazing. Its a short but sweet game, im pretty sure theres some replay value to be seen but i havent checked that out yet.Overall the game is great, ive watched youtubers play it a long time ago when i was really young and even played the original for myself a year back before i knew a remake was being made. It was nice to see it remade and would recommend this over the original.

																I remember playing the free game 10 years ago and simply being sucked into the game. I'm so so happy that I get to re-play it again on Steam.Ib is a horror VN about a girl (Ib) who gets trapped in a fantastical world inside a museum of a famous artist. She and another poor soul who gets trapped in this world (Garry) now must navigate through this world and find a way back to their reality. This game gives us a very fascinating world that makes you want to explore it as much as you can, as well as know why it even exists, it has also a great set of characters such as Ib, Garry, and Mary who also are this game is great, and the puzzles itself are rather nice to solve, a bit of a challenge but nothing too difficult. It also has 7 endings in total.Horror-wise, Ib is pretty light in that department, no jump scares or gore, it does have a couple of chase scenes but overall nothing too terrifying. This paid steam version, adds a lot of improvements like, bigger resolution, clearer artwork, the ability to zoom in the screen, better dialogue screens, and my most favorite feature, the ability to talk to your companion anytime in the game. The characters are part of what makes Ib great and being able to talk to Garry at any time was an added bonus. It definitely enhanced the game.Some puzzles were modified, which for some I did not mind (it was an improvement) and for others, I felt disappointed but it's not a deal-breaker.Overall, I definitely recommend anyone to buy Ib, it's a great game that will suck you in.

																Never was I fond of pixelated graphics but Ib made me look past that. What stood out for me was the soundtrack which is surprisingly very pleasant to listen to. It ought to be included for or with the purchase. Ib contains a whole lot of creative ideas spanning level design, brain teasers and horror elements. I found the story enjoyable and of just the right length. If there is anything which surprised me in particular, it is how emotional things turn out. I like to be surprised and I was. Kudos to that.For maximum effect, I recommend playing this in the middle of a dark, silent night.

																Played the free version a long time ago and bought this on short notice after the announcement of an EN translation. I expected it to be the same old game with "higher res" sprites, but it had more to it than I thought.For one, the revamped puzzles are less number-heavy and more dynamic; certain puzzles are never the same from one playthrough after another. Being able to talk to the party members is also a big highlight considering the game's characters; if you're all about that character interaction, this version has you covered while you backtrack. Qualities of Life are also welcome, such as the game not spamming "You don't know this word" after the first time you see it, easier ways to get back to the title screen and/or reload, the  True Exhibitaccurately pointing out how many artworks are available. These are all a refreshing take especially if you're trying to get all artworks and endings.A notable change is the  dream sequence. Genuinely surprised me with the fake save point and rose. Sadly some nuances from the original were lost along the way; certain sound effects were completely changed in favor of being "less scary" such as the wall hands, the wooden fish puzzle, and even damage effects. The revamped layout also pushed certain events out of the way  such as the gallery itself panicking in crayon the first time Garry uses his lighter . Minor details, but in a game like this, details matter.While I like the simplified puzzles, we ended up losing steps along the way, notably in the bonus dungeon on your second run.  The Orange Area no longer needs the star candy for the key to the Cyan Area; the "night" version of two paintings are easy to miss this way. The Cyan Area's Guertena pieces have also been reduced from 12 to 6.  A shame, because the puzzles are a big highlight for a creative game. I simply wish there was more in it, minus the numbers.Overall, the remake is worth picking up, whether you're a freeware veteran or a newcomer just for the sheer amount of creativity put into it. How often do you see art museum-themed games with clever solutions and endearing characters?P.S. Fix the grammar on the only achievement this game has.

																It's with heavy heart that i have to leave a negative review. The original Ib was one of my first loves in regards to RPG horror and i was so excited for this remaster, only to feel a little disappointed.Having gotten all the endings and completed the gallery, i can say it is not worth the $12 price tag.Many iconic things from the sounds the hands make coming out of the walls to Mary's original theme are gone for no apparent reason. Additionally, there are changes such as the UI for the roses which now clashes with the aesthetic of the game. Finally, there are no additional dungeons or endings to help give you reason to further explore the game, instead only giving you the gallery which is a little tedious and doesn't provide much reward. There are some quality of life changes that are greatly appreciated: mostly changing obtuse puzzle solutions. The ability to talk to Garry and Mary when in your party to get little dialogues is also nice and cute and a good way to encourage a little backtracking.It's worth mentioning that graphically, there isn't much difference between this version and the OG. The biggest difference is mostly the CGs looking nicer in the remake. Sprites look a little better but are not mind blowing. Unless there is a massive addition to the game, If you have to buy it, buy it on sale.

																10/10, LOVE IT. absolutely stunning game. It's simple, but it's much more of a game to me than most many others. I'd say it's like a vessel of an art style, creativity and passion, which is art, what games are supposed to be in the first place. I loved every second of me wandering in that art gallery, which makes me wish I could be in world of Guertena as well. (without the horror part ofc) thanks for helping me discover my fav art style and making this remaster to the beautiful game. Hands down the second of my fav games just below tf2.

																For how relatively short the game is, Ib is just as beautiful as I remember. It is a simple game, but it was captivating from start to finish. If you played the original version from the early 2010s, the remake is a vast improvement that I highly recommend if you have the cash. It not only changes the art direction, but some of the gameplay as well.All in all, it was wonderful playing this masterpiece again :)

																RPG maker is a deceptively powerful medium and makes for stories that are more compelling than you'd ever think. Ib is no exception. I took the time a year or two to play the RPG horror classics like Ao Oni, Misao, The Witch's House, and Mad Father, all of which I had only watched on YouTube when they became popular more than a decade ago. Although all of them are precious, Ib is the most charming. The game takes no more than two hours to complete and accomplishes so much in that short period of time. There are seven endings in the game, each of them heart wrenchers which are a testament to how simple yet excellent the atmosphere and narrative is. The changes in this remaster to the decade old freeware edition only serve to further improve upon the original, a relief as remasters and remakes so often fall short and become misguided. The game holds artistic merit the same way an early silent film would, both limited by technical resources but not by imagination and creativity. Everyone should play this classic.

																I played and loved the original version of Ib. I wanted to get this remake, seeing as I enjoyed the Mad Father remake. Seeing the Ib remake is double the price of the Mad Father remake, I expected more substantial content. I was wrong to expect this. The game is just the original with fancy lighting and new character portraits that I dislike the look of. No extras. There is only one achievement for the game as oppose to Mad Father's numerous achievements. The new puzzles are a nice improvement but every other drawback tells me that the 12 dollars is not worth it. If this game ever goes on sale, it might be worth picking up. At full price, as is? I do not think it is worth it, seeing as the original is still free. Buy the Mad Father remake instead, a lot more love and attention was put into it.

																I did *not* expect to love it this much. Since playing the To the moon franchise earlier this year - and since I've hurt my right hand and cannot play most games - I've been trying to check RPGmaker titles such as this one, Oneshot, etc. Ib has a completely different vibe from the others since its focus is horror, so I didn't know what to expect from it, but damn, it's so good! It's a short game, but you really bond with the characters (And I mean Garry. I freaking cried TWICE?) and the whole atmosphere makes you jumpy af. It's creative and great, and it will make me look forward to find more horror RPGmaker gems like this (I am, however, passing up Corpse party for now because I don't have an stomach for gore)

The art, music, character development, and story direction keep you entertained and engaged.Having played the original 10 years ago (2012), I was expecting to buy this game and play a graphically updated version of the original. I was wonderfully mistaken. All new puzzles and character interactions along with the beautifully redone artwork. I'm definitely glad that I bought this instead of going back and just replaying the original.My nostalgia may be swaying me, but:9 out of 10

																This game changed my teenage perspective since  in 2012 or 2013 or somethings. Back then my PC can't run any AAA game back then but I found this masterpiece game which required a little spec but It's still touched my heart since then. Even now I have higher spec PC also can run AAA's game nowadays but it can't compare to this "type" of "Indie" game. It changed me that the simple game could be differently still on my mind like IB.

																Ib is a remake of kouri's 2012 RPG Maker horror game of the same name, though odds are you're already aware of that if you're here. Regardless, whether or not you've played Ib before, you've likely heard of it if you have any interest in RPG Maker games. It's an RPG Maker classic, and for good reason. Everything about this game is masterfully done. The spritework is charming, the soundtrack is ambient and eerie, and the story is engaging and bittersweet. Being an RPG without any battles, there's not much to talk about in terms of gameplay, though there are a healthy handful of puzzles scattered about the museum you'll be traversing, and the atmosphere is so cohesive and captivating that the simplistic gameplay won't bother you much anyways. This version of the game has been entirely remade in RPG Maker MV, with all new sprites for absolutely everything, uncompressed music tracks, and even a few new puzzles and areas here and there. However, the changes aren't drastic... certainly nothing that necessitates playing this remake, I would say. It's about 95% the same game. It's definitely a fun new way to play through Ib if you've played the original before, and if you're a new fan, you won't be missing out on much by playing this over the RPG Maker 2003 version. I cannot stress how much I don't want to dissuade anyone from buying this remake, as Ib is still a fantastic game either way and kouri deserves all the support he can get, but I would only do so if you've tried the freeware version first and enjoyed it. They are so similar that there's no real reason not to, unless you just really want to burn through 12 bucks. If you DO end up liking Ib, however, definitely consider buying this remake. It's a great and easy way to throw a few dollars kouri's way and show him some appreciation for putting out one of the most iconic and memorable RPG Maker titles ever.

																I initially discovered this game by accident while browsing YouTube, I've seen the game's soundtrack, clicked it, then it caught my attention how well composed and captivating the soundtrack was. Even though I didn't know anything about the game, I felt an irresistible pull to purchase it, I wanted to witness the soundtrack in the game itself, it's a psychological horror and a storyrich game, so I was already sure it would be amazing, and I was right, it turned out to be a masterpiece. This game not only delivers an unforgettable atmosphere but also features clever puzzles and a richly detailed world that you can fully explore in under 10 hours. With seven unique endings, each revealing a surprising twist, the endings, every single time didn't fail to surprise me, they were really well-created, I was like "wow...", each time I witnessed an ending. Every choice you make changes the course of your journey. It’s a brilliant, immersive experience that truly would keep you on your toes. All of the artworks were amazing as well. Overall, I’d rate this a solid 9.4/10.

																The game is nice! I can say it's worth the money - at least on sale. However, for me (and probably some others), opening the game for the first time gives an error popup reading, "Profile error occurred.Your profile can not be used because it is from a newer version of NW.js. Some features may be unavailable.Please specify a different profile directory or use some newer version of NW.js".To fix this:- Right click on Ib in library- Go to properties --> installed files --> browse local files- FInd "package.json" and open it in Notepad- Where it says "name", put "Ib" into the second set of quote marks- Save and exitYour game should now be clean!

																Definitely worth the money spent on it. The game is not very long, but there are many endings, and the remake as the opposed to the original has some changes that are very nice - at least aesthetically, not to mention the two new endings and new sizable area. Gameplay wise, I love it because it doesn't rely heavily on jumpscares, but an overall unsettling atmosphere that holds tension. Not that jumpscares necessarily detract quality, but horror games that rely too heavily on jumpscares are generally lacking in other departments.

																I've always been a huge fan of IB ever since I was young. I played both the remastered and the old version of the game and I can confidently say my opinion overall stays the same. The story is amazing, but it's not very long (the game has different endings though so I guess it makes sense), the concept of roses is absolutely amazing and pretty unique if i might, the characters have very nice designs and nice characterization, which made me pretty much love and attach to Garry. For the gameplay, it doesn't have much aside from puzzles and different endings. The puzzles are pretty nice and somewhat straightforward (at least for me), while the different endings can be a little more demanding if aiming for the achievement, at the end it's worth it honestly. The music does not disappoint either, the majority of osts fit the context pretty well and some are straight up iconic, just like the main menu ost and the prelude. The overall design of the game is veryyy good like the main menu, the map and mostly some of the work of arts inside the map. I highly recommend this game to those who are starting out with these kinds of games, but even if you're not, I still recommend it!!

																pretty fun, but short game. not like thats a bad thing though, the game has plenty of endings and most of them requires you to do everything perfectly, so the game being short makes this much easier. kinda makes me miss old rpg maker horror games aswell

																What more do I say? It's been years and Ib still stands as one of my favorite games of all time. The music is incredible, the artworks are diverse and charming, and there's also completionist content for people like me! There's a reason this game is still going despite the trials of time.

																One day back in ye ol' 2014, when I was hanging out with a friend, she decided to pull this exact game up while I watched her play through it. I was so intrigued, that I ended up downloading and playing through the game myself so many times that I was able to beat it in my sleep (My obsession with it was so bad I even ended up emulating it on my phone so I could play it on the go). When I found out that it was finally getting officially released in English I couldn't have been more excited (so excited I ended up getting it both on here and on the Switch). If you're a horror fan then this game is definitely for you as it provides one of the best horror experiences out there.

																Been playing Ib ever since the old version came out, it's safe to say I've replayed this game for over 100 times, so comparing the two made me notice some things that I wish they would have added in this version as well. (Don't focus on the time spent on this game from Steam, I only found out about it being available here today)First of all, I'm really pleased with the graphics improvement, and the ability to zoom so we can see paintings even closer. Being able to chat with Garry and Mary throughout the rooms is another bonus that I really enjoyed, it made the game more immersive and gave us more depth to the character's relationships with each other. However, with the improved graphics also came some negative aspects, where some of the paintings do not seem as eerie as they used to in the previous version. Take the lady who smiles after Ib takes her first key for example. She is no longer creepy, but rather...just cute. Another thing that bugged me was the fact that the hands from the green and yellow room now no longer produced a sound that I found in the old version scary at first, it really added to the horror aspect of the game. Speaking of sounds, again as you're chased by the statues and ladies in the paintings, the sound effect no longer has an impact that had you feeling like you were actually running away from something. Mary's theme also changed, but maybe that's just my nostalgia that's speaking that prefers it over the new tune, but I don't mind that change that much since the melody is also nice. The thing that I did really like was the addition of another Lady in the painting with white hair and hollow eyes, which made perhaps the toughest (tough is a hard word, but compared to other rooms it is tougher to complete) level even better, and I really liked other new artworks, such as Porcupuss and Guardian of Time, although I wish some of the things from the older version still remained in the game, such as the maze which helped you raise your points with Gary.All and all, I still adore this game, and it has been my obsession for the longest time ever so the remake was, in my opinion, much needed to bring people back to this masterpiece.Will absolutely be playing again. 11/10

																An incredible re-imagining of one of my favourite games. The new option to chat with Garry or Mary adds so much, and easily my favourite change to the game. The new visual style is great, along with the map layout changes, the updated puzzles are much better, none of them are too tricky, but they're all much better than the ones they replaced.The only change I didn't like was the change to Mary's theme, even if it was overused in RPG Maker games, I think this is the game that defined it, and her new theme just doesn't fit sadly. It's not like this change ruins anything, though, as it's still the beautiful and charming game I remember playing, but enhanced to be better than before <3

With all of the beautiful pixel art, music, and lovely characters you can't help but adore! All with this wondrous fairy tale feeling of dread- I really can not recommend playing this beautifully done remake enough. I could absolutely go on, but to avoid any spoilers-It is my promise that you'll have a wonderful visit to this museum! I do hope you'll give it a try <3

																The 2022 remake of Ib is a solid remake of an amazing game.This game's story, characters, and beautiful art have been an inspiration to me for years. The atmosphere is fantastic and the distinctive visual style is a lot of fun. Just looking at all the bizarre paintings is a motivation to continue in itself. As someone who grew up with this game, I obviously have a lot of investment in the original game.The rest of this review is less about the game itself and more about its' quality as a remake.I can say without doubt that this version is definitively the best. There is now a button to press for dialogue with characters in your party at any time, and it's a nice treat to get new dialogue for them. The graphical quality has received a nice little boost, and it's easier to tell what some of the paintings are supposed to depict now.Some of the puzzles are slightly less obtuse, meaning this version might be more accessible.I'm not fully convinced that all of the improvements truly justify replacing the original version, though. Ib (2012) is still available online, completely for free. There are no major flaws that needed to be addressed by a remake, and the experience really isn't that different. The only change that I'm truly not fond of is the health bar. Ib (2012) had a picture of your character's rose in the corner, with the visual state of the rose showing your character's state. If the rose wilts, so too will you rot away. However, in Ib (2022) that visual has been replaced with a symbolic rose icon, where your health is instead represented by thorns. This change weakens the impact of the rose in the story; Visually seeing the rose lose its' petals gave you more of a connection to the characters' situation.Other than a few paintings missing, that is the biggest problem I have with Ib (2022). Rather small compared to the good changes, but as a long-time fan, I feel that the iconography of the rose is important to the game. All of that being said, Ib (2022) is most certainly best version of Ib, and personally I'm happy that the game is getting more attention. In any form, this game will be a good time, and if you want to pay 10 dollars for the small improvements then I see no reason not to, because this game is good.(I have currently only completed the main route of the game; If there is more to be said about subsequent playthroughs and post-game content then I will be sure to come back and re-make this review.)

 Ib: A Cult Classic Gem That Still Shines You know, I have a soft spot for indie horror adventure games, and when it comes to classics, Ib holds a special place in my heart. I mean, it's been over a decade since its original freeware release, and it's still as captivating as ever. Now, with this remake on RPG Maker MV, I was a bit skeptical, wondering if it would retain the whimsy and charm of the original or fall prey to the dreaded soulless remake curse. But boy, was I pleasantly surprised.From the get-go, Ib sets the stage with a strange and unsettling art exhibit that pulls you right into the madness of artist Weiss Guertena. The atmosphere is eerie, the puzzles are creative yet challenging, and the characters, though brief in appearance, are endearing and fully fleshed out. While it may not have traditional RPG elements like combat or character progression, its meaningful story and multiple endings make it a standout in the adventure game genre.As you guide Ib through this bizarre world, you can't help but feel the influence of Alice in Wonderland. But believe me, Guertena's world is darker, claustrophobic, and far deadlier. Yet, it's so wonderfully appealing with its weird and whimsical art style. The way the bizarre creations come to life is both captivating and unsettling, and the use of crayons in certain scenes adds to its childlike charm.One of the things I love about Ib is that it knows how to build tension without relying on combat. Running from foes, solving puzzles, and avoiding danger keeps you on your toes. The difficulty is forgiving, and the generous autosave ensures that failure is a learning experience rather than a punishment.The haunting music and spot-on sound effects make the whole experience even more immersive. The eerie soundtrack perfectly complements the creepy ambiance and adds feelings of loneliness and helplessness. It's easily one of the game's strongest points.Sure, Ib's gameplay may be simple, but that's what makes it so compelling. The interactions with the characters may be limited, but they quickly become memorable. And despite the short playtime, the game packs a punch with its multiple endings, which can be a bit tricky to figure out without some help.As a fan of indie RPG Maker horror games, Ib was a delightful journey into the past—a golden era of creativity within a limited toolset. It's a testament to what independent developers can achieve when they let their imagination run wild.So, in conclusion, Ib is a special little gem that still holds its charm over a decade later. With its haunting aesthetic, unique world design, and clever puzzles, it's a must-play for horror fans and adventure game enthusiasts alike. Sure, it may have its quirks like the unexplained bond mechanic for certain endings, and the controls might feel a bit stiff, but those are minor bumps in an otherwise fantastic experience.If you're looking for a short and sweet adventure that leaves a lasting impression, Ib is the way to go. It's well worth your time and money, and I highly recommend diving into this eerie and captivating world.

																I played this game 10 years ago and it's still a fantastic experience.One of the coolest additions in this remake is the insane amount of new dialogue with Garry/Mary. Not only is there new dialogue for each room, where you can speak to them by hitting E, there are also an insane amount of variations based on location in the room, events that you've just triggered, etc.At one point, Garry and Ib have to cross a small rainbow bridge, and I was shocked to see that he had optional dialogue before, during AND after crossing it. Entire sections of the game that easily could have been blocked off from before you meet him also have unique dialogue the entire way back to the beginning, which was incredibly fun and encouraged me to return and reread the painting titles for the 100% achievement.If you're in too poor of a financial circumstance to purchase this game, I'd heavily recommend the original 2012 release in lieu of it, though this remaster definitely trumps the original in most/all regards.

																The beloved 2012 RPG Maker classic Ib is back. I highly recommend it for old-time players seeking to relive the nostalgia and new players alike.Some of the key differences in this remake are some of the level layouts and puzzles being changed, removed and even brand new additions to make the Art Gallery make more sense and be less difficult and more streamlined. The graphics have also been improved and a zoom mode was added which I didn't use much, but it's cool that it exists. Plenty of UI changes/art improvements too.However the best feature of this remake in my opinion is the talk to your partner feature. It's really interesting hearing Garry's thoughts and opinions on various areas, events and puzzles and learning a bit more about him (Mary too!) and seeing their relationship with Ib. A TON of dialogue has been added via this feature alone, I recommend using it alot. It primarily feels like fanservice for old-time Ib players and might be a bit tedious to new players though but it adds alot of life to the game. I just kept talking to Garry after doing literally anything lol.Oh and a useful piece of advice to keep in mind is that there's an achievement for seeing all 150 of Guertena's artworks, so be sure to interact with everything (and with Garry present if possible since they don't count if Ib's 9 year-old brain can't understand the words).There's a few minor downsides(?) in my opinion, though I don't even know if I'd actually complain about them, but I thought I'd list them anyway. The UI is different and while I'm all for it, I do miss the old health system of seeing the rose decay and wilt with missing petals the more damage you've taken instead of the color just fading like it does now. Mary's theme also seems to have changed due to copyright, but I ended up warming up to her new theme in the end. There's also a chase sequence which was alot more intense on the old version (loads more enemies), but it's super dumbed down and easy on the remake.Basically Ib modernized but a bit more easy with some additional features and some new content. Interesting for old and new players. The original is still free, so you could always just play that too. If you're brand new to Ib, you could go with either version honestly but it's nice to support the creator after such a great game being free all this time.

																Ib is a classic RPG horror game that i think everyone should try. While the price on steam may hold some away, the story and gameplay make up for it imo, combined with good soundtrack. There are multiple endings, and a few things you can do after completing the game. Overall Ib is a good short game i wish i had played earlier in my life, but i'm happy i got to play it now.

																It's only fitting for a game about art to have such fantastic atmosphere, in all senses of the word. Not overtly frightening, time-sensitive moments notwithstanding, but unnerving to be sure. The life meter gives you leeway, but the puzzles will test you—both those in plain view and finding the paintings out of sight. A single playthrough is short, made up for with the multiple endings and endearing dialogue options you'll get to experience.Fun and mysterious. Buy on sale

																I've played the OG and I gotta say, this renewed version is pretty good. Some puzzles are different and I really like that, it helps refresh the game for me. I gotta be honest I completely forgot about the King Pie story show and had a very good time going through it again. The layout of the gallery is changed to better suit the story and little things are changed, I appreciate that very much. Originally I played in Traditional Chinese and so I did this time as well, and although the translation can be improve on, I LOVE the fact that for the painting 憂鬱 this game included the Taiwanese alphabet when Garry is explaining to Ib, just like in Japanese there would've been Japanese alphabet for pronunciation. And the fact that there's specifically Traditional Chinese in the first few major update is like a salute and acknowledgement to its massive amount of Taiwanese players and popularity in Taiwan when the OG game came out. Thank you for not forgetting about us. I love all of them tbh, they're all my baby, even the blue creepy dolls, I used to draw fanarts of everything all the time...This game holds a very dear place in my heart and now that I've been struck by the most massive nostalgia ever I'm gonna go draw fanart of everything like 10yrs ago...Bless the creator and bless whoever made this happen.

																Is amazing to finally get to play this on steam after so many years since it's initial release, the game is still just as atmospheric and mysterious as when I played this back in 2012 when the free version was out. I wasn't able to fully appreciate the game due to language barrier right now but will definitely come back and give my full thoughts once a english translation has been made.EDIT: So I got to playing this finally after the english update and it sure was one hell of a ride!It still feels and retains the original atmosphere from the free version and the new content doesn't sour it but makes the game feel more complete, It has a nice new polish to it that helps it feel a bit less homemade and more professional without losing it's original charm. I think I got more startled by this version then the original at some points! a lot of spooks are so well placed and unsettling. All in all I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the free version of Ib or just horror rpg makers in general, Ib is easily one of the most best RPG maker games ever and without being over the top or edgy it's still scary at some points while being relatively mild in it's content. Is one my most favorite rpg maker horror games and no collection is complete without this edition.

																Ib is a fantastic RPG Maker Game, however this version of it is lacking. Not enough has been changed or added to warrant the hefty price tag ($18 AUD). It makes sense re-releasing other RPG maker games on Steam as a lot of them were hard to get running (The Witches House for example), but Ib never had this issue.  Even considering the 'ease of access" having it on Steam, it shouldn't cost the price it does. I really love Ib and had played hours of it as a teenager when the "final" version with all of it's content was released and that version was free. I don't mind paying to support the creator, but it really isn't worth it here. I'll still play it but I recommend waiting for a sale or download the free version instead.

																Ib has to be one of my favorite games. The story, characters, creatures, background; everything in it has always been a beautiful mix of art and horror! I played the original for years and couldn't even wait for the EN patch to release before I played all the way through it!(If you want to try it out but can't read Japanese, capture2text is a wonderful program that helps!) Kouri is a masterful game creator and the love put into this game shows. I still find new things every day and I can't wait to keep playing more.Thank you to everyone who worked on this game, it brings me so much happiness each and every time I open to play it.

																I barely remember playing this game back in the day, I was so young and didn't understand everything, but I loved. The vibe this game provides is so unique and nostalgic. It had some updrages for this steam release, but almost 90% of the core game is here. Funny how I'm completing the game way faster this time, perhaps I was too dumb when I first played, but nonetheless some puzzles can make you stop for a while (in a good way). If it is your first time playing, I hope you love as I love this game. I just miss the old feelings I used to have when I remebered about this game, the mistery combined with the theme song combined with the multiple endings it has, makes this so special.

																I only saw footage of the original so this first comment is a guess:The remake looks easier and smoother. The horror elements and story are truthfully ported apparently.Bad parts first:Fetch quest chores can overwhelm, some hidden object quest drown in background colours and active elements and hints appear too random to solve the riddle, very rarely though. (Twice in my case)Low replay value as commonly in story-driven games. Experience puzzles and scares once, then speedrun re-attempts since nothing changes which is kinda boring.The game also doesn't clearly specify how and when your choices matter.Good parts:The atmosphere is pretty good, horror elements keep the player engaged and there are a lot of interesting and clever little interactions. Controls are simple, the game is tight, linear. Art, music and story are decent.The biggest shock I had was figuring out that CHOICES MATTER for the MULTIPLE ENDINGS.Good focus on few key characters and not tons of empty husks.The game hits different. It's pretty chill and could be way more horror and less linear puzzle game.That said it was an absolute treat to play and didn't overstay it's welcome with weird achievement grinds.Essentually another glorified walking simulator, it does a mighty fine job being memorable. Big thumbs up.

																Ib is a beautiful story. I had played it before on another platform and bought it again so that I could continue to play it forever. It is a rather short story once you know how to solve the puzzles, but I don't think that takes away from any of it. The game is a great time, and has many different endings. I played it as a little girl and still enjoy it now in my 20's.

																Ib is one of my favorite games that i played for the first time about 10 years ago. I really enjoyed reliving my old memories in this new version with a few new puzzles. I do unfortunately think some of the changes aren't great, for example I didn't like some changes to the music and I do think the sounds of several enemies are downgraded. I think enemies over all sound less threatening. I have collected all the paintings and done 5 endings in less then 10 hours. I think it will take more time for a new played who never played Ib before but I would probably recommend playing the original for free rather than the remake. I highly recommend buying the remake if you think the creator deserves the money for the product, I definitely do.

																One of the many remade RPGMaker classics that have been a common place in the late 2010s to the 2020s. I had this game since last Christmas I think and decided to play though for this spooky time of year. I wouldn't say Ib is as scary as its contemporaries such as Mad Father or Witch's House (Hell, I'd say this game isn't really scary at all) but it does beat its competition in style and atmosphere. The Fabricated World is strange and surreal, nothing is as it seems and you're always wondering where Guertena's mind was in each and every single one of his art pieces, especially Mary and his self portrait. The dynamics between the main trio is fun and makes you wish all three could see the world outside the the fabrication. The music is also really solid, ranging from creepy music box tunes, to dreary ambiance, to soothing acapella guitar songs. The only real complaint I have is that the the Health Indicator isn't as used in the remake isn't as cool as the one used in the original, the visual of Ib or Garry's roses falling apart as they take damage is way better than a rose icon losing color. Ib's earned it place in the RPG maker community as one of the classics and it nice to see Playism brought it to a new audiance.

																Whether you've never played the original 2012 release, or if you've played through every update, this is a great game to add to your library. $13 for a piece of horror game history. Just be prepared to hurt, no matter the ending you get. Ib is known for being bittersweet and brutal. Also of note: there's no modding features, so none of the "good" endings of the fanmade green version, and the requirements for Promise of Reunion have changed.

																Along with Yume Nikki, this is one of the pillars of the genre. Never played it before, did so in one sitting, was exactly the sort of experience I was hoping it would be. It's a little on the short side, but the experience is unique enough that I was okay with that. If you are a fan of the genre, you'll most likely enjoy it if you haven't already played it.

																Ib, an evergreen. I remember watching videos on YouTube and playing this many, many years ago. It was huge, everyone talked about it and it led to a series of successes to similar games such as Misao, Mad Father, The Crooked Man, To The Moon etc. If you were around during the gaming landscape in the early 2010s, you knew about Ib. It was really creative then, and to many degrees it still is now.Preview of Ib below, if you want to support my channel. I upload videos to support my reviews!

When I saw that Ib was coming to Steam, I just had to wishlist it. It's been at least 10 years since I played this.Always ThereI felt I've never really forgot about this game, since everything felt so familiar when I began playing. And that's because your first playthrough will be exactly as you remember it to be. The only real differences are of course some mild added mechanics such as a simple zoom in to further look at the various paintings or characters.The gameplay is exactly the same: a linear adventure with various puzzle elements, easy but satisfying to solve. You  can talk with your "allies" while walking around various areas, and there's quite a lot of dialogue. Speaking of which, dialogues are not particularly complex and for the most part they fall flat and feel sometimes too "anime-ish". Ib's strength is not found in how dialogues are written, rather than the experience and the atmosphere it manages to put you in, which for me makes up for everything else. On the other hand, though, art description is well made and interesting to read all the way through.What's IbThe premise is rather simple. You're with your parents and you're going to visit an exhibition of various art pieces made by the fictional artist Guertena. While exploring around the area, strange things begin to happen and suddenly you'll be introduced to an otherworldly section where you'll have to find an exit in order to survive. This, of course, isn't Ib's main focus. The whole core concept is based upon art, and it's safe to say that it delivers in such sense through the interestingly vivid yet minimalistic Guertena works. The subtle animations give depth to the things you see and manage to describe the artist very well. Even though many years have passed, I have to say that Ib doesn't lose itself while going forward, meaning that art will always be the main concern with the plot. So much so that the plot revolves around that in every sense, but I won't tell you why since I don't want to spoil everything. :)To sum it up, the art direction on this game is clear and manages to be coherent all the way through, with various interesting ideas scattered here and there, and an atmosphere which will always be remembered. I haven't said anything about the score, I know. I'll just say that the melodies of Ib are echoing in my mind since I've first booted it up. I think that speaks for itself. Moody, warm, deep and "Rule of Rose"-sque. It captures well the whole "rose" deal they came up with.New Content?I'll admit that having the possibility to get other endings is exciting and I'm willing to go through the story one more time to discover additional areas. The fact that after so many years we've gotten new content in Ib is really cool, and I can't wait to play more. I'll eventually update this review after I've done a second playthrough.With that said, I can't recommend this enough. It's an interesting game, and it's basically history. It's a must have for people who liked games such as Yume Nikki, Misao, The Witch House or To The Moon. If you're into those kind of games, you won't be disappointed, trust me on this! If you've played this in the past, I still recommend buying it to support the developer as well as enjoy the new content which has been added.More reviews:https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodolovsello/recommendedYT:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXMd490dpLAJxONpEpvOMnw

																Where to even begin! I've loved this game since the boom of RPG horror games, and have, at one point, made multiple saves achieving all the endings prior to playing its Steam version :) Steam version has improved so much in puzzles, dialogue, art, and music!!  I do still wish for an ending where all 3 of them make it out... like... plz ಥ‿ಥ  but overall, the game is as beautiful as the first time I played it and I hope more people get to experience it :))

																This game changed my life. It's short, it's simple, a girl gets lost in a museum and from there the horror starts (it is a horror game, be careful if you are not into that stuff) but something about the aesthetic, the characters and the world itself get's you. I cannot recommend it enough, play it. It has multiple endings and maybe you will need a guide to get the best one but the game is short enough that it's not a problem to play it multiple times.This game inspired me into making my own indie game (it's a slow process but I'm having fun). For that I will be always thankful.

I was worried that too much would have been changed with the remake, but my worries were completely unfounded. If you're a fan of unsettling horror games with minimal jumpscares and a focus on puzzles, this is an absolute must-play.

																I was recommended this by someone who's into RPGMaker games, as I was too, and at first I thought it to be a simple puzzle game with no real story. The beginning is slow, but once you really reach the rising action of the game, the characters and mystery surrounding this odd world is intriguing enough for a pleasant gaming experience. It's a short game, but the amount of endings and 100% completion let me enjoy the game for much longer than I thought I would.

																One of the game's main strengths is its ability to create a pervasive sense of unease and tension, achieved through expert design of the environment, music, and sound effects. The game offers an immersive experience, with intricate and detailed environments that convey a sense of familiarity and discomfort at the same time.IB features puzzles that are both challenging and thoughtfully crafted, requiring a combination of observation, exploration, and logic to solve. The game offers multiple endings, each dependent on the player's choices, adding an extra layer of replay ability and encouraging players to fully immerse themselves in the game's intricacies.The game's story is another standout feature, as it offers a complex and twisted narrative that keeps players guessing until the end. Characters are intriguing, with backstories and motivations that are gradually revealed through carefully placed clues and interactions.Overall, IB is a well-crafted and effective horror game that stands out in the genre. Its attention to detail, immersive atmosphere, and intricate storytelling make it an unforgettable experience for players who enjoy psychological horror games. If you're looking for a game that will keep you on edge and fully immersed in its world, IB is definitely worth checking out on Steam.

																this game is so odd but so good. it's the only horror game i've ever beaten (on the non steam version, which is why my playtime is so low on here), largely because once you know how it works it kind of just turns into a standard adventure game with a spooky atmosphere and some startling moments. but also it can still absolutely get me freaked out even now. anyway it's really cool aesthetically, i love the weird dreamlike atmosphere

																I first played the original Ib back in 2017. It is one of my favorite games of all time! I remember this game was still a bit obscure and lacked much of a fandom or even merch, despite it being such a staple for the RPG horror genre. When I heard it was getting a remake, I was ON it. This version didn't disappoint. Polished graphics, expanded dialogue, fixed puzzles, and extra content! It changed quite a bit but still had the same charm. It was like playing it for the first time again. The bonus dungeon and the True Exhibit gallery were awesome additions to this game, I spent two days making sure I completed everything for the steam achievement. If you've never played Ib, YOU NEED TO! Especially if you're a fan of other RPG horror games like The Witch's House, Mad Father, etc. It's a bit on the shorter side, but the characters are so well-written and unforgettable. The music and the atmosphere is one of a kind and will have you fully immersed into it's strange world, but I won't say too much so you can experience it for yourself. I can tell the creator put so much love and passion into the game's story, characters, art, and mechanics. You might feel pretty emotional by the time you've completed all the endings of the game, so bring tissues. And again, PLAY IB!! You won't regret it! <3

Ib has so many things about it that I love, from the soundtrack and creative art pieces in the art gallery, to the short story that slowly reveals itself throughout the game and multiple endings - it's all so lovely made. My favorite though were the surprisingly complex characters, whose fate depend on your choices made while playing. I really like this game, big recommend :3

																There are some horror RPGMaker that I enjoyed more than Ib, but I can see why Ib is deemed a classic horror/RPGMaker game. The story is rather great with interesting casts, considering its short duration. The puzzle difficulty feels just right for those who play for just the story/horror experience. However, if you want to get all 7 endings by yourself, you need to play at least 2 walkthroughs with few loads to earlier saves which could be cumbersome.My only regret is that I left Ib on my wishlist and Steam library longer than it could've been.

I don't remember too much of the original rpgmaker2000 version so I'm not sure how much has changed but everything seems to flow pretty nicely in this one.  In trying to get all the paintings though, beware that 1 painting in the brown area you can't actually get until you reach the cyan area, which is a NG+ area.I definitely recommend picking this up one it gets an English localization.

																I was more than happy to pay for this game after years being in love with it, I was addicted back in the day and even managed the best ending first try this time around! For all of you that loved the original, you will definitely enjoy the new puzzles and looks while feeling the nostalgia, it got easier and more fun to me personally. It doesn't have as many jumpscares as other RPG Maker games of the time, and that can be a plus for many since then you are more open to explore the world without being too wary (I say that while also personally liking jumpscares anyway).I'm tired and don't have the mind to write all of my thoughts right now lol, but I wanted to at least offer a coherent review, Ib deserves it.

																i actually love this game, but i give a thumbs down because the price point feels pretty ridiculous for the time a normal person gets out of the game.There is clearly a lot of love and passion put into it, but it's very, very short. a walkthrough of this game on youtube takes under 2 hours, i could buy hollow knight or something for 1.5 more and get 5 times the hour count, and mine is skewed because of being afk in the game. i think i did get like 7 hours out of it maybe 100% it. it's a remake of something published for free so the price is even more questionable.for actual criticism? i think the game is great for what it is. it has a great atmosphere and soundtrack, aswell as tons of cool pixel art. +multiple endings based on your choices throughout, and then you get some additional content on your second playthrough, aswell as a satisfying reward for completionists id rather not spoil. i'd recommend getting the game when it's on sale, but you should be aware of the amount of time you're actually buying.

																Ib is a really interesting and oddly charming Puzzle Adventure Horror game!Its got a really unsettling atmosphere throughout thanks to its soundtrack and really unique art. The puzzle solving mostly is also really good too with every solution feeling really intuitive if you've been paying attention, but also unique and clever with it making really good use of its setting as an art gallery. Many of the horror elements I also found really fascinating more than anything and the overall narrative was pretty dang solid!and most importantly: GarryI do however have a minor gripe with this game when replaying it. After finishing it, you already know the answers to all of the game's puzzles since all of them have a set solution. This wouldn't normally be much of a problem but  the game has multiple endings, encouraging you to play through it multiple times. A lot of the endings also have very specific conditions that are extremely easy to miss. I recommend using a guide for specific endings BUT ONLY AFTER your first playthrough. It would have been nice if the puzzle solutions were randomised, but it's not a deal breaker especially if you're only going to play through it once. Ib was a really enjoyable time overall! I ended up liking it a lot more than I would have initially thought. Give it a go if you're curious about it!

																For ten years, I've been meaning to play this legendary title. Having been one of the big names during the time of the RPG Horror Golden Age, it was the talk of the internet alongside games like Mad Father and Witch House back in the day. I was so happy to see Ib get a remake for Steam, as I had been wanting Ib to join the Steam roster much like it's other fellow legendary titles I mentioned above. So, I bought Ib and FINALLY played it...it was amazing!I love these games for how creative they are. They just ooze raw creativity, you can tell the creator enjoyed making it. That makes me enjoy it even more! The concept was interesting, the characters lovable, and the game simple. This game was short naturally, around 2-3 hours tops. But for people that wish to see everything the game has? Get all collectibles? See every ending and get extra lore? Seems to be around 10+ hours. I'm at 10 hours at the time of writing this review, and only have a few endings left to see before I've seen every inch of the game.If you love story driven indie games fueled by pure skill and passion, you'll love Ib. It truly is a legendary classic as the people say. Highly recommend.

This remake does full justice. The same vibe with slightly updated graphics and a few more puzzles to complete was enough to feel like a throwback while still feeling new. As a Garry fan, being able to talk to him whenever I wanted was a huge treat. I love this game so much.

																When I initially played this game, it felt a bit off. I've come to realize that it's because they changed some of the puzzles. It's a bit saddening to me, since i love puzzle games, but the other additional content makes it totally worth it even for if you've played the original. I would recommend this game to anyone who's interested in trying ib for the first time as well as veterans.  If you're unsure, try finding the original: it's free. It might also prove to be a better experience, if you're in it for the puzzles.

																Ib is one of those games you beat with a bunch of questions, like who Guertena is, who Mary is, what even is the sketchworld at the end? It's cool, and the whole story of the game is very intriguing. It also works pretty well as a horror game, with places that give you a creepy feeling like the sketchworld, or genuinely tense situations like the doll room escape sequence or escaping from the paintings after getting the gray key. The puzzles also work for not being too hard, but still requiring you to think. I wish the requirements for the different endings wasn't so strict, but I guess that's a personal thing. Final thing to add is I like the guitar tracks from this game's ost. So yeah cool game, definitely worth trying out.

																I've loved this game for so long and have always wished for a way to financially support the creator somehow, and I'm so happy people finally can. This game genuinely changed my life and was the first horror game I've played and completed by myself. As for the remake, it retains most of the core game while improving and adding new character interactions and puzzles (no more math!) that are very welcome. I will say that I felt some of the scares had more impact in the original, but otherwise is a significant improvement to an already incredible game. This game is just very atmospheric in a way that sticks with you for years and its scares don't rely on blood and gore. Proper care is put into each painting and extra info about the museum to make it really feel like you're wandering through the gallery of an actual famous artist (even though he's completely fictional). Something I really appreciate about Ib is how accessible it makes horror to people who might otherwise be scared of it. As someone who loves horror games but usually can't play them myself, Ib gave me plenty of scares but it wasn't so terrifying that I couldn't progress. It's also about 2-3 hours long but it genuinely feels longer than that. If you want to see everything the game has to offer, it WILL be much longer than that. There is a story that helps make everything cohesive, but it doesn't get in the way of anything. Many RPG maker games tend to focus heavily on story with gameplay as an afterthought, but Ib's puzzles and atmosphere are well thought out and memorable. If you really like good puzzles and heavily atmospheric games, I'd definitely recommend this. Now I just want more accessible merch LOL

																I first heard of Ib when I was a young teen, and at the time I thought it was one of the greatest stories I'd ever seen. Now as a young adult having 100% completed the remake, I can say with certainty that Ib remains an excellent story-centric horror adventure that could both warm my hardened heart and keep me up at night with worry (thanks, Final Stage.) While the decision to switch from dark, messy sketches to brighter pixel art may be questionable as an aesthetic change, I enjoyed many of the other changes and new features like zooming in and the ability to talk to Garry on command.Talking to Garry itself is especially praiseworthy as there are multiple location/event sensitive lines in a majority of rooms in the game. For example, if you find the hider in the room of curtains on your first try, you can get a unique reaction from Garry for every other curtain if you backtrack there. That's a ton of optional dialogue that is incredibly easy to miss since not every player would be tempted to backtrack after finding Garry, and those who would backtrack would've also probably checked every curtain before moving on. While talking to Garry in this way is now tied to getting the game's good ending, it is only necessary to see 20 of the 200 or more new Garry lines to get the highest possible bond from doing so, leaving you free to not talk to him for long stretches without getting a less happy ending.The sheer attention to detail in Ib is commendable, and feels increasingly special as the AAA games industry slides further towards rushed releases, homogenized gameplay, superficial choices, live services and maximum monetization - with few exceptions.

																When i saw this was added on Steam, and completely remade too, i had to buy it INSTANTLY (it's been here for a while apparently, but i wasn't aware until now). I played the old freeware version just last year and it was one of the best games i've played, and now with updated graphics that are actually pleasing to the eye unlike the freeware version where my only minor problem was that the graphics were a little too minimal even for my liking, it's even better. As far as i've played, they've removed at least one part of the game, but that was one of the more annoying parts anyway so i don't mind it too much. This version seems to be more visual in many ways anyway (just like the Corpse Party 2021 compared to the older versions of the game, which i should in fact finish too and review it as well), i'm really liking this even better so far. If you're into puzzle solving/mystery/horror kinda stuff, please just do yourself a favor and play this, it's totally worth your time! Really creative and unique game both storywise and in terms of the puzzles, and the graphic design too now that it actually does look like something more detailed too. I'm pretty sure you can still download the freeware version too, but i'd go with this one anyway, or both, in case you want to see the differences. RPGMaker horror at it's best, along with Corpse Party!

A story that's creepy but wholesome, short but whose characters have left such a long-lasting impression upon me.After playing this remake and looking back at the 2012 version, the updated graphics really are night and day, adding that much more atmosphere and polish while still feeling true to the original Ib. Definitely worth the play, both for those new and nostalgic.Also, Mary a cute.

It would be nice to see an English translation, but I've played the original so many times, that it didn't matter much to me (Edit: I am so glad an English translation has been released haha).The characters are simple but well fleshed out, and find ways to tug on your heart strings.

																The original RPG Maker horror classic, redone in a higher screen resolution and new engine for it's tenth anniversary. If you're new here: Ib's brand of horror comes with a focus on puzzles, characterisation, and atmosphere. It's popularity partially comes from the fact that it was designed with genre newcomers in mind, so if you don't usually like horror this is a good place to start. There's no shock imagery, the scares are pretty restrained, the puzzles are fairer compared to other games of the era (lmao Ao Oni), and while some horrible things can happen to the cast if you're not careful they can usually be undone in another ending. ...Y'know. Usually.If you're familiar with the original: keep in mind that this version focuses on art/quality of life improvements, and doesn't contain much you haven't already seen. Some of the more obscure puzzles have been tweaked or outright replaced, chase sequences have been rebalanced to be more forgiving, and as far as I can tell there are no new areas or endings. It also adds the ability to talk to your companions at any time, which either gives you puzzle hints or fun dialog depending on what you're looking at.Bottom line: If you can't afford it, you can give this version a miss and play the original without missing any story beats or endings. If you can afford it, then this is a very solid remake that refines the clunkier parts of the original without messing with the parts people actually like.Either way, Ib is one of my favourite games of all time and worth checking out.

																This is very similar to the vgperson release that I played a long, long time ago. It was quite a trip down memory lane for me to return to something from my teenage years but with enough mechanics that are different enough to give it a fresh feeling. I'm doing my best to get all the endings at time of writing, and the exhibit addition is definitely enough to make you play through multiple times. I thought I had gotten all the points needed for the True Ending (no spoilers), but was turned down. I guess I'll be playing it for many more hours until I get them.

																Man, it feels like yesterday when the original came out. It's nice to see this game after 10 whole years! There are many endings that you can get depending on what actions you take in the game and I'd say it's worth playing if you are a huge RPGMaker fan and whenever the English translation gets released of course.

Overall Rating ★★★★☆Story ★★★★☆Gameplay ★★★★☆Graphics ★★★★★Soundtrack ★★★★★Sound Design ★★★★☆Difficulty ★★☆☆☆Bug free ? ★★★★★PC Requirements ★☆☆☆☆Replay Value ★★★☆☆Strongly Recommended - ✔✔After playing and reviewing The Witch House, I decided to continue my marathon of iconic independent RPG and what better way to continue it than to replay after so many years the silver medalist of the independent horror RPG podium: IB!Here you play the eponymous hero of the game, an 8 year-old girl named Ib who goes with her parents to a post-mortem exhibition of a very popular artist named Guertena. After looking at a strange painting, she finds herself in a parallel universe where Guertena's paintings and sculptures come to life. You must therefore survive in this sometimes surprising and sometimes frightening universe where you will meet different characters.So we start the game without being given too much information in the narration and this is already one of the strong points of this game : Most of the information is kept quiet. Unlike games where you are given all the keys to move forward and understand, where you can be disturbed by a scenario or elements that you don't like, Ib gives you the advantage of making your own story. The characters will give you some information, but it's up to you to interpret what you see. This kind of game has always had the merit of being considered incredibly original, and Ib is proudly part of it.Your goal will therefore be to get out of this museum with cursed paintings. You will never know what wants to harm you but you will want to escape. Not to mention that your red rose linked to your life, loses petals with each attack by these monsters and that you cannot defend yourself... But you will not be alone in your quest : A very effeminate and pleasant twenty-something man named Garry and a little blonde girl with blue eyes named Mary will accompany you.Having discovered and played IB for the very first time as a child, I had no idea that I was going to face a horror game. Because after all, with such 2D graphics, how can you be afraid of 6 moving pixels? Well yes, you will jump on your chair of surprise sometimes. The atmosphere of anguish is very present and very well transcribed.Speaking of atmosphere, the vibe given to the game is very special, having sometimes made me feel deeply uneasy. The game really succeeds in making you feel like you are in a gallery haunted by the creations of Guertena, a somewhat... special artist? And this through the very many paintings filling the gallery, the books telling us the story of these paintings, the puzzles related to them and the emotions they can make us transmit (it is quite special and incredible to make us feel emotions through these processes). Horror is also used intelligently to contribute to the atmosphere. The character of Ib, so small in the middle of the gallery, whose gloomy atmosphere is very well rendered, makes us, in spite of ourselves, tense up on our keyboard. The enigmatic side of the game, also, helps to perfect this gloomy atmosphere wonderfully: no indication, no arrows, no path to follow, no tutor or mentor who guides us during the game, nor any scenario indications. This disturbing universe will lead you to be curious and never get tired.For the gameplay : it's flawless for me. You should know that the vast majority of the gameplay is based on exploration and puzzles: The puzzles in the game are very interesting, tough but not impossible, allowing you to solve them while feeling proud of having accomplished them, very few of them rely on randomness not allowing you to go random and hope that it works.The exploration is also good, you have to explore a lot to continue the game but that the exploration is not restrictive, that the game makes you want to explore, thanks to its secrets, its many paintings etc... Bonus, to support how good its gameplay is: when you have to restart the game to do another ending, it does not stop you, it is quite easy to start again. Because my god it is annoying when you can not solve a puzzle that you already know because you had to do THIS action first because otherwise the variable does not work (sorry it is a bit technical but that is how Rpg Maker works, the program in which Ib was made), Ib very rarely has these problems and it is really pleasant to be able to redo it easily to explore all the endings. The aesthetics of the game are magnificent and original. At first terrified, we discover and delight in every detail of the story, which will gradually reveal the secrets of the world in which Ib is taken. The fact that the game is (relatively) short is ultimately an advantage when you want to replay the game to get another ending, because the outcomes are multiple. The scenario is very rich and has many twists and turns. But what you should remember the most is that you will be entitled to about ten different endings depending on the choices you make. So replay the game if the ending you got doesn't satisfy you, you will discover a new facet of the exhibition and new answers to your questions.Ib is a game that moved me a lot when I was younger, a game that changed my vision of what a good video game is. A game that showed me that you don't have to play a Light Novel to have a good story, that you don't have to have good graphics to have an incredible atmosphere, that you don't have to make a love story to make a relationship between two characters very touching. The story has no major flaws, nor did I see any huge inconsistencies, which puts us even more into the game. The story is full of mysteries that are complemented by different special events triggered by different fairly logical sequences of actions and/or with the endings. We can therefore make connections on our own, guesses about the sequel or the mysteries, etc... which is really nice and makes us "enter" the universe of IB. To come back to the different endings of Ib: they are also very good, leaving us with no bitter taste after having done them all, they are also accessible quite logically, so we can discover them without having really followed a guide but simply by our simple spirit of deduction (I personally had to look at a guide to do only two of them, and my god these endings are hard to achieve even with a guide which I find quite negative: having to talk 25 times to a character specifically at a time to unlock an ending. I say no: it is neither logical, nor intuitive, nor fun. Fortunately the excellent ending "A Painting Demise" makes up for these dozens of painful failures.) I would like to add that the option in the menu to be able to visit the real exhibition is just so great and satisfying: Finishing the different endings and discovering each work of the game and its titles will fill the real exhibition and we will also be able to find the important characters of the game to chat with them. It's a small bonus, very satisfying for any collector (even more so when you know that you have to finish completing the exhibition to get the game's only achievement on Steam).In short, Ib is an excellent game developed by a single person, which still beats three quarters of current AAA games. This is the perfect example of what is good in a horror/indie horror rpg and when I was younger, it made me discover a whole section of a genre of games that I did not know, the Indie Horror type Rpg Maker and I am very happy to have discovered it. It is illustrated by an excellent atmosphere, excellent gameplay and a very good story. Ib is striking, surprising, pleasant and will leave you with a very good memory. This game personally marked me, it touched me deeply, it will remain engraved in my memory like a thorn in my heart.

																Another great and an amazing old school RPGMaker Horror game. Beautifully written and designed, but sadly, the overall game was very short, and didn't have the best replay value as some of endings were not really worth the amount of time you would have to put in to get them, it's much more recommended to watch them on YT instead. But other than that, the first playthrough experience is definitely worth it, the level design and characters are fantastic.

If you like yume nikki, mad father, and other similar games, you have to add ib to your playlist! If you like surrealist style games with a focus on puzzles and character interactions, you should also add it to your playlist!ib is a classic for a reason. Play it!!!

																This game really checks all the boxes for me: an immersive story, logical puzzles, spooky environment, multiple endings. Almost every choice matters--yet very accessible to different skill levels with lots of replay value. Even more than that, the vibes, music, character dynamics, and very gothic-style premise in this game just scratch an itch I didn't know I had. It's really compelling--I got really attached to the characters and have been alternately delighted and devastated by some of the endings. Ib is easily a top ten game for me and I've consistently been recommending it to everyone I know for at least the past five years.

Thou I would still recommend the original to people the remake is better in every way and has even more in it then the original.

You get a better visual experience, polished dialogues and better puzzles while keeping the same story and feeling that you got when you first played that obscure indie game.That being said the new character sprites and style might feel a little off if you are coming from playing the original version, but you get used to them before long.As with the original game you can finish it in a couple hours with all the 7 endings so don't come hoping for a longer experience or to find some new lore/content.

 YOU SHOULD GET THIS GAME Played this game before it was on steam, what a masterpiece. I discovered this game from an ex youtuber which happen to be one of the creator of the hit music 'Lathi', you should listen. Anyway, bought this on steam to support the dev and hope for a sequel or similarly, these kind of indie games need your support and truly can give you an unexpected pleasant experience. 9/10.

																I love the characters, except Mary is kind of annoying imo, even despite the obvious reasons. Pretty sure I got it for free a few years ago. Not entirely certain about that.Really nice to play, even multiple full game playthroughs back to back, which is usually something I get bored of easily. Great story. I love Garry. I wish I could learn more about Garry. And Ib. That would be so interesting to me. This game has helped me relax my mind for a few hours at a time, as I await the return of my missing cat these past few days.The art style is lovely. After the fourth playthrough, you get used to the sort-of-jumpscares. I really want to get all 150 paintings! I'm only at 117, currently.

																I never played the original and I kind of forgot about trying it out until I saw the remake. I really love the game! In a way, it's cute, I love the interactions between characters (and the characters themselves) and I like some of the puzzles. I don't like the chase scenes a lot but they aren't too bad. I've only gotten 2 endings so far (have to go through all of them) but I really had a great time playing this.

																Out of all the RPGMaker games I have played, this one is definitely in my top 5. It's a fun, sweet story with lots of exploration and a strange, neat lore that pulls you in. When you're done, it just sits with you for awhile like Yume Nikki, To the Moon, OneShot & The Witch's House.

																A creepy/cute adventure game with a simple story told competently.The sound effects and art do a decent enough job creating an atmosphere despite the limited visuals. The characters aren't given much depth, but they are still enjoyable. Having gotten the good ending on my first play through, there really isn't anything compelling me to go back and see the other endings. The game is wildly overpriced and should only be picked up on sale a few dollars. As a short spooky experience though, you could do far worse.

																the original game literally shaped me as a person, i had to buy this version if for nothing to support the artist. however, this really is a good remake! i am a little sad that the style changed. Perhaps i had an emotional attachment to the other one but it did feel a bit more authentic. Despite the change I still love the art <3 really good game!

																I wish Steam had a neutral button. I don't want to give it a "not recommended" but I wouldn't particularly recommend it unless you've played the original and are a superfan.To put it bluntly: despite being made for an improved engine, it feels less polished than the original game. Some of the new touches are cute, like the stool from the yellow area, or the newspaper girl in the white area, but other changes feel weaker than the original puzzles. For what it's worth, I think some of it is to reduce difficulty for new players, which is fine.I think the real issue comes with the visuals. Some of the new sprites are beautiful. Some of the new portraits are stiff as hell. Ib's dad looks very weird, though I'll admit that no one would probably notice unless they played the original game as much as I did. The new lighting is acceptable in the gallery, but it looks downright terrible in the sketchbook; the original sketchbook area is neon crayon art, that's the point. The new lighting system does not match the design at all. It should be bright, it should clash.Despite everything, I think I'm marking this as recommended. I still had fun, it's still the game I knew and loved, even if I do think the original version is still better. I appreciate all of the new dialogue between the characters a lot, even if it is just padding. This is effectively a donation button for fans of the original game, with a cute little remake attached.

																This is probably my favorite game ever! It's a very lovely game with a beautiful soundtrack and wonderful characters. I first discovered the original version of this game when I was 14 and watched countless videos of it on YouTube. This was my first time playing Ib and I hadn't watched a single gameplay video in years, so it felt like a fresh start! I am absolutely in love with the story, the worldbuilding, the characters, and music. If you haven't played this game before but you're a fan of anything to do with alternate realities/worlds (Alice in Wonderland, Wizard of Oz, Coraline, etc.), horror, and/or art, then you must play this game.

																This game is fun to play if you're into RPG maker games without RPG battles.Although this is a remake of the original classic, it's still fun playing through the game plenty of times just to get all the paintings and endings.Also there are extra rooms to explore after beating the game.This game is very underrated in my opinion.I like the characters and the concept of a spooky art gallery game.I also found some differences with the original version and this remake which were the graphics, some of the puzzles and most rooms look a bit different.Also this game could have more achievements than just collecting paintings but then again this would hide the fact that this game has 10 different endings, one of them having a credits scene.

The atmosphere and the memorable characters is definitely worth checking this gem out. A must play for people who enjoy a classic tale that is still remembered today.

																*Completed at 85 minutes*I look back at this game with such fondness. Listening to the fan music as a teenager and replaying this game with my childhood friend over and over was a darn blast. Watching Felix and Mark play this game growing up just solidified my absolute adoration for this game.When i found out it had gotten a remaster (??) and that it was on steam  instead of the usual rpg website i screamed. Id gladly pay for this game any day ( and its not even that expensive????) Of course i had to play it. AND LET ME TELL YOU!!The music brings me back, the audio brings me back, the monsters brings me back. It is like reliving my childhood. When i heard the music again all i felt was nostalgia. a teenager me playing this game in my room at my dad's place after school or during a weekend after binging Inuyasha.Blast from the past.Its not long but even if it was i still couldnt recommend this game enough! 10/10!!

																Can't go wrong with a classic! Even if it's not the actual classic and only a remake of said classic.Faithful to the original- feeding into lovely nostalgia- while giving a fun update to the art and puzzles! Although, I was a little let down by the newer puzzles... Why dumb them down so much? It takes a bit of the fun away and honestly feels like an insult to older players 💔 I'm not too upset about it though, the only thing that actually upsets me is the changing of Mary's theme???? Whywhywhywhywhy when the original was so good and iconic !!!!! 12 year old me is withering away because of you !!!!

																i was looking for games like omori, and Ib is somewhat reminiscent of that. the puzzles are fun without being too abstruse. i really enjoyed it for being laid back with its puzzles and not something that makes you contemplate everything you've done over and over. i love the atmosphere in this game and i wish the soundtrack offered a little more variety to complement that because the music is a little bare-bones. overall the game keeps you intrigued with its unique themes and fun characters despite not having much depth, and you probably won't be astonished by it or retain a certain feeling from it upon completion, but i do believe it offers enough of an enjoyable experience to make it worth the buy.

																100% recommend.After almost 10 years I first played this, it was so much fun to play again.There's no mistake in picking the remake. Some puzzles are more well-rounded, the updated graphics are really good, and the remake bonuses improved a lot the experience of exploring the game.

																Just finished an unforgettable playthrough in 4 hours.  There's a good bit mroe for me to see now with the expanded stuff.If you've seen a full playthrough with all the endings, its still worth playing tbh, the chills and anxiety get to you.  They redid many puzzles and scares and such.  Its a great experience, I havent forgotten it since I saw it over maybe a decade ago.If you havent, you're brand new, still a fantastic experience, again I found it unforgettable.  Dont wait for a sale, its something you should have in your life if you value art.

																Ib is a psychological horror masterpiece set in an art museum that tells so much within its short 2 hour runtime. Despite being a short game, Ib poses many complex themes and ideas that it gives most major games a run for their money at showing them how to create immersive worlds and levels without getting dragged out. The setting of exploring an alternative world of the museum where all of the artworks and statues are the main enemies is such a amazing unique concept that is incredibly engaging to play through. The music is fantastic and sets the eerie atmosphere, and loud well timed sound effects shatter the silence when exploring the map. Ib plays with themes of psychosis and alternating perspectives, combining these two things delivers a one of a kind horror experience that is perfectly brought to life in this remaster, one of the better remasters ever released. The characters are memorable, the setting is stylish and the whole experience is unforgettable. 9/10.

SUCH a landmark title that deserves endless praise, admiration, and to be so thoroughly dissected, analyzed, and adored by thousands of people. The art, the characters, the music, the design choices, all of it flows so beautifully. Everybody needs to buy 5 copies of this game right now so it makes just as much as AAA games. I hope the upcoming Switch port exposes so many new people to this masterpiece and am looking forward to another 11 years of this game living in my head.

																The first time I played this game was way back in 2012 when it first came out. It was what introduced me to gaming. When I heard there was going to be a Steam remake, I was so excited! I wondered how much would change. I enjoy the fact that there are fewer number puzzles than there were in the original, and I love the new design of both characters and environments. A surprisingly tough little game with an awesome plot and wonderful visuals. Do yourself a favour and come join Ib in the art gallery! You'll never want to leave...

																About 6 years ago I discovered the original Ib. It quickly became one of my favorite RPG games of all time. The art style, the unique story, and the characters blended in so well. To my surprise, an Ib remake mysteriously showed up on steam about 2 months ago. I quickly purchased it and played through all of the endings over again. This remake is great, it adds so much more depth to the original museum by adding more rooms and puzzles to explore. My only flaw upon this remake is the removal of Mary's song "Puppet". Puppet was replaced with a new song and I don't understand why. The new song is good but in my personal opinion will never be as iconic and haunting the original is. Other than that one flaw, I really enjoyed replaying Ib. It doesn't deserve to be as underrated as it is, and is in my personal opinion an RPG maker classic.

																This was actually the first time I played this game, I only saw bits and pieces of it without witnessing any of the endings.I am genuinely surprised. This is immersive story-telling and progress felt natural the whole way through. I actually cared to see all of it, which I always appreciate. Sound design and music were top notch for the tense mood of an unnerving place.I wouldn't recommend this to just everyone obviously, but anyone who is interested in game writing or just surreal art and horror in general should play this through. It's inspiring me.

																ITS SUCH A GOOD GAME it literally has been a part of my childhood since the fan lyrics to 'Puppet' . if the original ib game had a track of how many hours ive put into that game id have well over 100. its a game that even if youve gotten all the ends and completed the true guertena museum you can still get into it. 10/10 , it also was very cool to have the puzzles updated, personally i wish they kept the sound effects for the cat room and the bridge guy but other than that. god i love this game

																It's the game you know and may have played in the past, but with better graphics and music. A short, but very entertaining experience with a surprisingly good story. If you're new to the world of RPG Maker games like this, Ib is a perfect starting point.

																This one is a classic for a reason, and the remake adds a lot of polish while keeping the authentic experience. I highly recommend western audiences try Ib; it's in many ways the ideal bite-size J-horror experience, never dragging too much or becoming annoying to play. The conceit of collecting all the paintings in the True Guertena Exhibit is also kind of addictive and gives you lots of opportunities to reexperience the game. The characters are all likeable, and also the walkthroughs are well-documented in the game's Steam guides section so you won't get hopelessly lost.Definitely try Ib. It's a game that's gotten something like a million downloads in Japan, but it's not very well-known to Anglophones, and that's a shame.

																I still remember the first time I played this after watching a youtuber (I believe it was either Pewdiepie or Markiplier), absolutely loved it. The puzzles were simple but fun at the same time. Every time I'd reset my laptop or get another one, I made sure Ib was the game I downloaded and installed first.One day I was scrolling through steam and found other games I used to play like: Misao and Madfather and that's when I saw Ib in my recommended. I added it to my wishlist and patiently waited for the English version to be released and BOOM! Here we are.Such a fantastic game with spooky moments and lovely characters (*looks at Garry*, haha)Can't recommend it enough.Oh, I almost forgot to mention, the new additions for this versions are great. Really liked some of the new puzzles and rooms.I am so happy right now. Garry is as sweet as he was in the original version <3

																Ib is a very cute and spooky game with a wonderful cast of characters! The game is very accessible and has many riddle and wordplay style of puzzles; as well as mazes and even the occasional chase. The soundtrack is phenomenal and the art is amazing! Especially in the original version, it has a lot of personality. The game has been completely remade from the original, all the art and animations have been completely redone and this has been the first official English translation of the game in its decade of existence. the game is relatively short but has many endings and lots of replay-ability, there are several 'harder to find' areas and TONS of dialogue.All in all i know i can't really write a great review but this game has meant a lot to me for a long time and it has been a wonderful experience playing the remaster for the first time and seeing all the new changes!

																This game is a true classic of Pixel Horror Games made in RPG Maker. This one is my favorite of others which were made in RPG Maker. I love this story since I knew about it in 2013 maybe? Such a wonderful game with little pinch of thrilling feeling. What I really like about this game is art itself. I love art topics like paintings, sculptures etc. And the fact that you can collect them and then see them again in Gallery is awesome!Also I am happy that this game is on Steam now and I can play it anytime. Thank you for adding English language by the way. And in general, thank you for creating this game! kudos <3

																I played this game when it was originally a thing with all the other rpg horror maker games, and it was my absolute favorite one. It inspired me so so much in terms of art and I just adored everything about the game and characters it self, I was pumped as hell when I heard it was being redone!!!!! and now its here, and Im playing it again, and I still just adore this game and love the updates!!!!Part of my wonders if things like endings from the older green version of the game will be added ever? those were all super interesting endings- but even if they dont get added this game is still absolutely amazing and I love it. I highly recommend especially for anyone into rpg horror maker styled games.

																If you haven't played Ib before, you're going to love this experience. It's fun, spooky, and emotional in all the right places. This version keeps almost all of the old version's charm while being more accessible and streamlined for new players. The story is great, the endings are fun to find, and the paint hunt is a completionist's dream. Absolutely worth the buy.If you're like me and are an old player seeing what's new, I cant recommend it enough. All the nostalgia of revisiting the Gallery is made better by the new artworks, improved graphics, and over all MUCH better sound design. While you may miss a certain musical track that got replaced, the rest of the game is beautifully in tact with just enough little improvements here and there to keep you interested. I have no regrets whatsoever in buying this remake.

																Although I am a writer, words are disappointing with how they could never truly convey the immense, unyielding love I feel for this game and what a perfection the game truly is. I have been with this game since it was initially released in 2012. For some reason, February seems to be the month I revisit Ib, replay it, write about it, and listen to it's music, and February 2022 seemed to share my nostalgia with the announcement for the release of this remake. I was ecstatic, to say the least. How do you make a piece of truly beautiful, artistic perfection even surpass itself? The concept of this type of attempt is rarely ever successful, but Kouri found a way.  I didn't think I could love this game anymore than I did before the remake's release, but I was proven wrong. I adore this game. This game has worked its way into my everyday life, it is painted into my skin (literally, I have a tattoo of a blue rose and a red rose), and it has taken permanent residence in my heart. The creator is a genius who speaks uncensored to the essence of my soul. This game is criminally underrated, but my hope is that a Steam release will enlightened many more to the true value of this game. My warmest gratitude to Kouri. Please know how loved your masterpiece truly is.

																Ib is a fantastic game. The music, the art, the premise, it's all brilliantly executed with charm.Having first played it in 2012/2013, I can say that the remake feels much more polished and feels like there's more incentive to explore than before. There's slight differences to some of the puzzles, but not an overwhelming difference, and they can be quite fun to solve. The sprites are also different, and look much more clearer than before, along with the dialogue for the characters being fantastically written and not too unrealistic. The English translation is very good and coherent! The zoom in tool, although I didn't find much real use for it, was also a very nice addition, especially for looking at the paintings closer.It's a shame the rose in the top left (representing Ib's health) in the original wasn't kept, now using a different picture, and I preferred some of the art for sprites in the original. I was also hoping that there would be at least another new ending or more backstory explored here, but I'd still recommend trying this one out alongside the original.All in all, a brilliant game that anyone can get into, and worth checking out, even if you've played the original before.

																I've had this username since 2014. You can probably guess what my thoughts on the original game were.Ib was literally my enitre childhood. I discovered it when I was nine years old (the same age as Ib!) and instantly fell in love. Ib was honestly the game that made me fall in love with video games as a form of story-telling in general. When I saw that Ib had gotten a remake, I knew I had to buy it. I was not disappointed. Even as an adult now, I still adore this game.Whether you're a longtime fan of the original or a new player, there's something here for you. The heart and soul of the game is still the same, but there are new puzzles and artwork for returning players to enjoy as well. I think my favorite addition was the ability to talk to Garry and Mary with a button. I hit that button every chance that I could because of how much I love these characters.Just play Ib, please. It's a great experience.

																The moment I saw Ib appear on Steam, I paid the $12 and played through everything in 1 session till I 100% the entire game. Perhaps this is because I'm biased, but Ib and The Witch's House were my 2 favorites back in 2013-2015. I had no idea Ib had a remake until the day I wrote this review.That being said, I can tell you with absolute certainty that this version of Ib is the better version. They changed the art style significantly, and Ib looks a lot more fleshed out as well as all the other characters. The dialogue is mostly the same, with some extra things thrown in here and there for touch-ups.They also changed some of the puzzles for the betterment of game design which is a MASSIVE plus. They did away with a lot of the "number" related puzzles (One example is the green room that once involved figuring out 3 numbers to multiple and add together to get the code to a door, now has been completely reworked so that you don't have to do that). Also, the new options of being able to talk to side characters at any point, as well as the new Zoom In/Zoom Out feature is absolutely incredible. They really outdid themselves this time by going above and beyond with the rework.As for criticism, I think this game can get quite repetitive if you're trying to strive for multiple endings. Ib has lots of different endings, and variations of those endings, but it's usually really tedious to get them. This has to do with the fact that the system they use to determine your ending usually requires analyzing decisions you've made pretty early in the game, as well as mid-way. So it can get quite hectic hopping around between saves, and replaying the same puzzles over and over again without an option to skip them, just for the sake of trying different choices. The True Gallery returns to Ib, and while there is one thing I won't necessarily spoil, I will say there are some "collectibles" that are very infuriating to locate without the walk through back on the original homepage at vpg translations. Some collectibles are even locked away without any way to backtrack and grab them. (Especially one in the blue room and brown room). Overall though, still absolutely love Ib, and I'm so happy to see it got a remake along with all of its other rpg horror cousins. Very much worth while for new players and old players alike!

Game is amazing, has some new content, music is crystal clear and while I'm not too big on some stuff (like characters portraits or the flowers having a more modern looking, gamey like UI instead of a painting picturing how damaged the flower is), it is still the exact same wonderful game from back then.You should buy it NOW

																I've been excited to play this since it was first announced! The game was very enjoyable to play through and there were a lot of changes to the layouts and puzzles! I haven't encountered too many glitches except for one. Overall it was still an enjoyable experience! I'm unsure if there are changes to the endings, but I have encountered the same ending three times while trying to unlock Gary's ending. There could be a possibility that the game is trying to actively make you unlock other endings to get the true end, but I'm unsure if that's true yet. (I'll be exploring the game to figure this out).I very much recommend playing this remake and  the older version of Ib. Both are very memorable and offer different kinds of experiences! <3

When i heard this game will out as a remake version, i'm so excited and immediately bought it and played it.So happy the game got improvement in the visual, and there is a few new stuff that didn't exist in the old version of the game. Last thing, the game has a new conversation text

																Ib is my favorite and most treasured game and has been since it came out back in 2012. It still holds some of my favorite characters after so long. The remake was beautifully done with many additions and changes that were great! The puzzles are always fun and I love the music even though Mary's theme was changed (the new theme is nice!). The new art is lovely and I adore the gallery for when you beat the game! Would recommend this classic rpg horror game to anyone! This exact game brought me into loving so many similar games such as The Witch's House, Mad Father, Misao, Corpse Party, Forest of Drizzling Rain, etc. Ib is definitely my most favorite though with the most unique story and creative, colorful, and interesting world! Thank you for letting me replay the game I have loved so much with this wonderful remake!

																I remember about a decade ago in early high school I played the original Ib. It was one of the 3 RPG horror games that got me into RPG maker games, the other two being Mad Father and Witch's House. Back then those were THE 3 RPG horror games you would think of, and this game holds up so well with it's beautiful updated style. PLEASE play it and support Kouri.Also yes, Garry is a true homie, I'd take a bullet for him. Comment if you agree.

																I found the story compartment to be more short-lived than expected, leaving more to be desired with the endearing characters and enthralling setting, but I wouldn't say that at the detriment of the games quality or writing, but rather in position of a longing, teary-eyed lover. ;-; That aside, I enjoyed the challenging puzzles, committed myself to collecting all paintings for longevity’s sake, and lastly, don't doubt the ost will have a long-lasting presence in my life.

I finished this months ago but barely got to giving this review now. words can't express how much i love this game but i hope Kouri knows she made a masterpiece of a game

																A game that I wholeheartedly adore. Ib is an RPGMaker horror game that I feel stands out from its peers like Mad Father and The Witch's House. A lot of RPGMaker horror games have very similar vibes and tropes, giving them while often times distinct feels, nonetheless samey ones. Ib is a noticeable departure from many of those tropes, with a unique visual theme and tone. It feels like a strange and creepy yet enjoyable daydream where when you snap out of it at the end you're still left with mysteries to turn over and characters to remember. It's charming, it's creepy, it's clever, it's amazing.

																When I saw Ib came out on Steam I freaked out lol!! As I had played this game a long long time ago, my memory of the story was foggy, therefore the first playthrough was very enjoyable! The story is just great. If you're aiming to get the achievement don't be a dumbass like me and be smart with your saves lol xD Although if you're dumb like me, you'll understand what I mean when I say the replay value of this game is amazing. I only wish there was an achievement for getting all of the endings or something like that. Definitely aim to collect all of Guertena's paintings as you'll get the full experience.Very very great game, do play it!Btw, if you want to get the true ending, do check Steam Guides instead of the internet, because as of right now (August) most of the guides I found online were incomplete.

																I love this game so much, so nostalgic yet refreshed! As if it got a new coat of paint ;pThe original Ib was the first RPG pixel game I ever played back when I was a teenager, so I was super hyped when I found out a rework was gonne come out.I have to say I'm overall very satisfied with this game! I love that the plot stayed the same and that some puzzles changed here and there. Music is great, the atmosphere is amazing and it is pretty spooky for a pixel game. I love the art a lot! Only wish Ib's dad didn't look like... that xD.I couldn't find different endings that are new, so I hope in the future there will be some added if possible.I mean, completing the True Guertena Exhibition took A LOT of trail and error and I just wish there were bigger, nicer rewards for completing it... I just want more adventures with Ib, Gary and Mary >3<!! I want to know more about Mary or Guertena himself!

																I didn't know about this remake until I stumbled on a random announcement on twitter about an English patch that just came out for it. I don't think I've purchased a game so quickly before.A remake of one of the classic staples of the Japanese RPG Maker Horror line up. But not in a bad way. Ib has been my favorite of this line for a very long time and this remake did not disappoint. The art and graphics are updated, most of the music is the same and some new features have been added! What surprised, yet delighted me was that there were new puzzles for old fans to try out. Some puzzles have been replaced, removed, added or revamped but not in a bad way. It keeps things interesting for older fans. A lot of room layouts have changed quite a bit as well.Everything has a nice glow up graphically and I really enjoy the 'talk to your partner' button. They have something new to say in every room and sometimes multiple things to say in a room depending on where you stand or what you've done in said room. It's a really nice touch.If I had any complaints, it would be the new health meter and the change in Mary's theme. I did like the original health meter and watching your rose lose petals instead of the new means where thorns disappear and the flower fades in color. But that's -hardly- a complaint and I'm kind of reaching when I call that a complaint. It is a shame Mary's theme changed as I much prefer the original, however I'm sure there's a reason for this. (Whether it be due to copyright or what may you)The extra bit of 'finding' the paintings and the requirements to consider them 'found' is a pretty neat addition and you may have to play through the game a couple of times to get them all as some depend on how you let an event play out. I thought I had gotten all of the base game paintings only to find that I missed two and one was due to how I let a event go.I can't recommend Ib enough. Both the original and this version. Considering the original game recently turned 10 years old, its a good time for this game to appear! Remakes don't always live up to the original. But this one certainly does and more.

																This game is very special to meI usually don't buy RPG maker games on Steam because my RPG Maker obsession ended way many years ago, before these many remakes started appearing, but when this one had the spothlight it was different, this is my FAVORITE from all the projects that came during those times, the one I could play over and over and over again without ever getting tiredAnyways, with that alone, yes, this game is totally worth itBut the stuff changed in the remake, even tho it's minor and I'm not a fan of all the changes, but most are for the bestPlus, now there is what I like to call "the Garry button", that olone made my new experience WAY betterI already 100% the game in 8 hours, but that's because as u can see, I know this game from top to bottom lol For anyone that is new or just hasn't played it in a long time, it will quite a long enough and great experienceThis is officially one of my favorite games in my whole library

																Ib is about a 9 year old girl named Ib who is getting lost in a big art gallery, after stumbling across a very odd painting she finds herself all alone...Ib is my absolute favourite game, I have known it since I was 9 years old, I am 18 today and it still gets me every time. I would have not survived my childhood with what this game gave me. I learned english from it, I learned friendship from it, betrayal, hope, seeing the better things in bad situations and it means so much to me.I would always absolutely recommend this game 100%, its a beautiful adventure with its small scares, heck, even my mother is a big fan of it. The remake is wonderfully done, a great step up but even the original is perfect. I particularly love the function to be able to talk with Garry and Mary whenever you would like to do. It gives the story so much more depth and feel to the trios bond. Absolute 10/10, truly a work of art.

																Ib is a game I remember first stumbling upon because of all the old vids that big name YouTubers had done on it. Most notably of that group of YouTubers being Markiplier and I instantly fell in love with this game! Especially considering I had played/watched some of the other popular RPGMaker horror games at the time. The game in its entirety was so fun to play through, get all of the endings and listen to the ost often. Seeing years later that it would get remade just as some of the other games had been (Misao, Mad Father) made me so happy. I love the updated sprites/graphics, the new additions with puzzles and the museum. This game I would very much describe as a comfort game as weird as that sounds because in a way it was "baby's first horror game(s)". I will continue to cherish Ib and its characters for a long time. I will never forget the first time I achieved the true ending way back when and I won't forget it now. This game is a treasure and I highly recommend it to those of you who are curious about it/have already known about RPGMaker horror games.

																I first got into Ib way back when, when I was just a 11 year old running around the internet. I came across a bunch of RPGMaker-based horror games, and while I loved many, Ib is the one that stuck out in my mind for a long, long time. The characters stand out very strongly despite the shortness of the game, and all manage to shine in their own ways, and the aesthetics stuck with me as well-- it was my first exposure to a horror game, leading me further and further into the genre. I said many times it was my favorite game of all time. So of course I had high expectations for the remake, and kouri absolutely, 200% delivered. Even just opening the title screen and hearing the music made me feel like I was home. The visuals are amazing-- they're a direct upgrade to the original game's graphics (including fixing text readability issues), without sacrificing aesthetic or the heart of a classic RPGMaker game. In a gaming climate where a lot of games will clamor to have the new best, most glimmering, most advanced never-before-seen graphics advancements in the world, that classic RPGMaker vibe that doesn't fight to add every pore to its graphics imaginable is a breath of fresh air. It's pretty, charming, and the pixel art is absolutely gorgeous-- I found myself often using the zoom function just to take in the quality of some of the work.The only thing I can possibly criticize here is that I feel the game can hold your hand a little too much with its puzzles sometimes. It may just be the brain of someone who's been obsessed with this game for years, but I do feel sometimes the game did a little too much wink-wink nudge-nudge. Even so, that's preferable to no direction at all, and it's really just a minor gripe.I know it's easy to be blinded by nostalgia because of my fondness for this game. But doing my absolute best to be objective, Ib is still a haunting game with a story that has stood the test of time, and I think even if this is your absolute first time even learning it exists, you'll have a terribly great time in Guertena's gallery.I'm gonna talk about spoilers past this, but let it be known that even if you can only read this far-- Ib is 100% worth your time and money. It's a great, atmospheric little game perfect for even those new to the horror genre, while still being deeply unsettling. Great characters, great environment, great story, 10/10 any story with haunted art still makes me go crazy in a good way.[Story spoilers below this point.]The story is just how I remember it, seeming pretty directly lifted. Which is no problem at all, because Ib has always had a great story and it maintains here. A chilling atmosphere without needing to be over-the-top, the sense of deep, permeating unease drags you in, the idea that anything in the gallery could reach out for you at any time. The fact that there's only very occasional chases adds to this, making you just high-strung enough without letting you get too used to it. Chases are generally simple but still stressful-- the escape from the Toy Box will always make my heart pound. Garry is an incredibly charming, sweet character, reliable as the only adult but obviously still stressed and nervous. Ib is a silent protagonist, but it's made clear that she is still a young girl cracking under the pressure. Their reactions to the gallery seem very real, adding further to the uncanny valley of just how unsettling this place really would be for someone. And of course, Mary remains one of my favorite antagonists in any game -- a young child who you can't fully blame for her actions, likely not understanding human morality from being raised in the fabricated world, that just wants to be real, but the only option is to do something terrible. It makes her as scary as she is sympathetic, and I think that's a strength of Ib. The tragedy of how the gallery works, of this inherent imbalance where someone must be trapped forever or even die, makes it all the sadder. I want Mary to be happy, wanting to escape isn't a bad wish and the circumstances aren't her fault, but I don't want Ib or Garry to die in the fabricated world either. It's just people at the whims of the gallery, and that's what makes it so compelling. Not to mention how charming Mary is, just as much as the other two -- yes Mary you DO look so cute in your scarf.The new puzzles are very fun, and I think the ones that were replaced from the original game make sense -- for example, replacing the equation in the yellow area with the tree windup keys feels a lot more artsy and true to the gallery than doing math. The teacup puzzle was fun and made me remember I'm bad at sliding puzzles, and I'm obsessed with that cat thing in the gray area. Also, oh my god the last chase in the grey area is so much more stressful!! I say that positively!! The changes to the puzzles in that area as well as the insanely stressful chase are top-tier, and I love that the nightmare sequence is so much more horrifying and now has control. Paradoxically, being able to move in that only makes me feel even less in control-- it's amazing!I could go on forever, really, I could, about the new graphics, new puzzles, how charming all of the new Garry and Mary dialogue is (and the time it must have taken to add all of it!), the cute new talksprites and how painful the one of Mary starting to burn is... and all of the music, god I could genuinely just gush forever. Also, did the doll room get its timer shortened or is it just me? Scared the ♥♥♥♥ out of me. All in all, Ib remains my favorite game of all time. Play it now.

																I like this game way too much for it to be healthy.I played the free version back in 2014, I think, and I absolutely loved it. Bought the remade version for the nostalgic feeling and in support of the creator.Even thought I liked the old design of the characters better, I think this new version is pretty good and worth a shot.In about 3 hours of gameplay I managed to get 3 endings, but still couldn't do the true one :( I'm getting there!I don't know why, but I really love Garry. Loved him in 2014 and I'm still not over it.

																I really love everything but just some small things I've noticed throw it off of the original. - The rose looks really modern and doesn't fit the "ib" rpg vibe, i wish it was more pixelated and actually looked like a realy rose- some shots of Gary make him look really young, however others do look really good.just some small things like this just throw it off from the original however, I really enjoy the small details and changes Kouri made to the game. the lighting and transitions are great.Can't wait for the translation!

																Wonderful game that IM SO GLAD GOT RELEASED ON STEAM!!!!Some things were changed from the original version,  such as the right side yellow room's change from luring a statue into a hole to getting a shoe for a stool in order to get the rest of the fish.  The changes didn't take away from the game though, and Ib still remains one of the best RPGMAKER horror games out there.It is definitely worth a playthrough, regardless if you can read hiragana or not.If you get stuck somewhere, the  Ib wiki [ibgame.fandom.com] can still help.HAVE FUN!!!!!

																I want to start this review by saying that I did not want to play this game. I'm serious! The only reason I did was as a part of a deal between me and a friend. I literally went into this game with the lowest expectations possible (not to say that I thought the game was going to be bad, just that I wouldn't enjoy it).And despite that... it's pretty solid! I played the original game and it itself was nice. The atmosphere was appropriately spooky, the characters were cute, and the story was fairly compelling, at times. This remake (which was gifted to me by aforementioned friend) only improves on the strengths of the original, while adding replayability atop the base game's normal endings by adding collectible paintings that you can view in your very own art galleria. If my impressions of the game, as someone who doesn't really play RPGs, was at least lukewarm, I can only imagine how much someone who does enjoy RPGs would like this remake. Highly recommend to anyone who does.

I warmly recommend this game for those who are looking to play something unique and  different, fun, misterious and intriguing, with lots of finals and hidden things; every new player should give a taste of what the golden age era of rpgs horror game, and I'd say this is a great way to start.

																i've been a fan of Ib for almost 10 years now, i've played the original dozens of times and got enjoyment out of it every time.when i got my most recent paycheck, i immediately set some aside for this game. i honestly expected to breeze through this game because of how much i played the original, and while i have gotten through a lot of stuff pretty quick, they added new puzzles that definitely threw me for a loop!!! some were harder than others, but none were hard to the point of frustration. i really enjoy the new puzzles actually!! i'd have to say my favorite addition to the game is being able to talk to your partner whenever you want, as opposed to the original where you only have a select few opportunities to choose to talk to them. the art is phenomenal!! i loved the original art style, and this game doesnt stray too far from that at all!! it's upgraded for sure, but it still has the same charm of the original art style.

The same amazing story as the original with some improved graphics and more interesting puzzles as well, along with new additions and areas and a revamped True Guertena Exhibition for completionists like myself. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who loved the original or who loves a good RPGmaker horror game!!

I've played this game over and over again making sure I got every ending possible. The new puzzles and dungeons were a lovely surprise and I look forward to sinking another hundred hours into this quaint rpg.

																4/11/2022It is just as good as I remembered it, perhaps even better. I simply, very much so, love it.A remaster of graphics, improved puzzles and even new puzzles. (I'll miss the math puzzle though)At the moment, it is in Japanese and I do not understand a single dialogue, nevertheless it still plays out the same as the original, just with some changes here and there. I will replay this when the English translation comes out.Overall a very overwhelmingly good recommendation!3/11/2025Came back to replay it. Still as good as I remembered it. This game is one of my all time favorites, I absolutely love it.

There are multiple endings and collectible works of art to find, but the game is short enough that getting everything doesn't take too long. Fun atmosphere, simple puzzles, and an endearing sidekick.It has Garry.

It's not particularly challenging but very intuitive with the puzzles and a lot of dialogue between the characters you can listen in on while wandering around the pretty art. Definitely give this a go

Garry is definitely the main man throughout the entire game & so happy to see Ib come back into the limelight. Highly recommend ✨️

																I was really excited for the Ib remake to come out, since the original is a favorite of mine. I'm very happy to say this is a great remake and that it actually improves upon the original game.I absolutely love the new conversation system and how it allows for even more dialogue/interaction with the characters. Additionally, I was pleasantly surprised by just how much extra dialogue there was. It may seem like a small thing, but it gives the characters more depth and makes them even more interesting/likeable (and this is coming from a person who already loved Garry in the original).The art has also been touched up and looks even better than before. These improvements are especially noticeable in the character sprites and CGs. For the remake, the puzzles were reworked and made to be a bit easier as well. Some fans of the original might have a problem with this, but I thought it was fine. Because of these changes the puzzles have a better flow to them and are suitable for players of all skill levels. Overall, I absolutely loved the Ib remake and would highly recommend it. Whether you've played the original or not, I think the remake is definitely worth giving a try. I'd go so far as to say the Ib remake is the best way to experience an already fantastic game.

																Short (2-3 hours max) puzzle/exploration game with pleasant music. Some mild scares, mostly in the first hour of gameplay. There is a story, but it's very light on the details and leaves some key things unanswered.I wouldn't call this game horrible by any means, but it honestly feels like a solid college senior final project. There is nothing special here, and I don't have any of the nostalgia that others here have (the game was originally released in 2012). It is absolutely not worth $13. If it's ever on sale for $2-$3, go for it, but if you don't have memories of playing this as a kid or teen, it may not land.

																This game is a remake of the original Ib from 2012.But as someone who has been a fan of it since years before it was made, I would say this is an Ib remake for Ib fans. If this is your first time playing or seeing Ib, don't buy this, and go play the original. It's free. The primary reason I say that is because the most integral part of the game was butchered.The aesthetic.Visual atmosphere is EVERYTHING in Ib. Without spoiling anything, it was built with darker colors and deeper shading in mind. The remake favors a more bright, colorful and retro aesthetic; which kills a lot of moments where the original's art direction would have been better for a first experience. The characters were also butchered with the brighter coloring, and it's so much less fluid. They come out flat, and some of them look straight up robotic.I'm not saying the art style is bad, but it doesn't work for the type of game Ib is, which relies heavily on visual direction. If you're a newcomer, then play the original first. This is an Ib remake for long-time Ib fans who already have experienced the original game.

																Was a fan of the original back in 2013, and I got to say this is a decent remake so far; I notice some new puzzles I don't remember that feels fitting to the game and that are welcomed. That and the new art style while different still haves that gritty look so I like it.To anyone new to Ib that sees this I'd recommend trying the original sometime if you can still.

																Every little detail matters. Ib is a game with multiple endings, requiring multiple playthroughs. Through each playthrough you’ll have to play differently, and for 100% completion almost every interaction matters. This makes Ib a memorable experience, with every area, puzzle, painting, character, and dialogue sequence being ingrained in your brain. This level of careful attention to detail, and overall quality of that detail, makes Ib one of the best RPG Maker games to date. The story itself is unique, and multi-layered, with repeated playthroughs containing details you’d miss on first glance. The game is also rather short, not feeling like a burden to repeat. The endings and extra interactions/dialogue sequences you’ll experience enhance your overall connection to the games characters and story. As someone who came into this with no expectations or prior knowledge, I’m ecstatic. Goosebumps covered me upon experiencing the true ending, overwhelmed with joy due to the trials needed to unlock it. While the gameplay is simple, given it’s a RPG Maker game, Ib manages to explore various different puzzles, each unique, culminating to the completion of each area. These get progressively more challenging, with some even requiring the use of multiple characters to finish.The games True Guertena Exhibit is the icing on top, as you explore an exhibit featuring all the games art work, music, and endings, requiring 100% completion to finish. Also the bonus content you unlock on second playthrough feels like a sizeable expansion to the games content/story, so you have more to look forward to outside of whatever ending you’re going for. Ib is one of those games that feels “perfect”, with no real issues outside of personal taste or nitpicks. An indie classic that needs to be experienced.

																you think that you wouldn't get attached to characters in this short game, but the dynamic between characters just hits you. and the game doesn't bore you because it has puzzles that are just really fun, good and worth sinking time into but you sink time into them not because they are hard, they are just fun to solve and it's kinda interesting and amazing to see how things connect. normally in games with multiple endings, I wouldn't bother to see different endings other than just the one I got first but this game's endings makes it worth seeing them all.

																Oh well, another one of those extremely, highly overrated Games.Is it that bad? No. This is like a 4-5/10, it is not terrible but also not as great as many people seem to believe.I've read reviews praising this as the best Game ever, not even exaggerating.IB is just okayish. I played through it twice but still felt I was wasting my time.I saw like 4-5 different endings and didn't want to find out about the rest of them. I didn't want to look up a guide, but I guess they are very specific.Also there is just 1 Achievement, I didn't even get that because I stopped playing because I really did feel that this was a time waster but not in a good way.The "NG+" Playthrough was almost the same with a few different choices that I made that had almost no impact story wise, so yeah, a few different dialogues here and there but largely the same.The new "Dungeon" was also pretty easy and I just wanted the Game to be over.I guess I could've "saved more intelligent" to see a few more endings, but I felt they weren't worth it.So yep, everyone is of course allowed to like this Game, but this wasn't for me.

																Really liked how the game was made! The puzzles were nice, but the story was missing some more depth. For instance, would be interesting to know more about Mary and Guertena himself. Yes it would make the game longer, but much more worth it in my opinion!Although the remake has a very good quality, I still prefer the original version :P

																IB is one of the most recognizable RPGmaker games of all time for good reason. The 3 characters are fleshed out in such a short amount of time, on top of having a beautiful story and fun gameplay. The visuals are striking, it uses the setting of an art gallery to it's fullest, and is genuinely so visually striking while still staying true to the pixel art RPGmaker style.A normal playthrough takes anywhere from 2-3~ hours depending, which given the price tag of the game is a bit steep. But the experience is well worth it and a must play for any RPGmaker fan. The game sports only one achievement which takes replaying the game several times, it can get a bit tedious at times but once you've played through the game once you realize how short it actually is. It took me only 6 and a half hours to 100% IB and see every ending and it was well worth it. Garry is the best, and the true ending is so touching... you have to play this game it's iconic. It's IB.

																I cannot ever get over this game, so simple yet so effective, I LOVE IT! I don't know how I have 20+ hours on this game but I'm not complaining either, I've played this game one too many times and I can see myself replaying it at least 10 more times still! It's just art, it's so fitting that a RPG Horror about an art museum is about and FEELS like art, I adore it! It's so good, it's so perfect! So simple yet so effective.AN AMAZING CLASSIC AND GOOD STARTER IF YOU WANT TO GET INTO THE RPG HORROR SCENE! It's not too much but it gives you just enough to give you such a simple yet engaging story.

																I fell in love with this game around the same time I fell in love with the original version of the game OFF, so it's been very nostalgic for me playing the re-releases. I love the art style and the characters in this game, and the world is just so compelling to me in a way that's hard to put into words. As someone who gets jumpscared pretty easily, I'd say it's on the lighter side of horror, so don't let that deter you from giving it a try.

																This was a very charming game. It's short and sweet. I'm a big fan of the art-style and atmosphere. I haven't played a lot of Indie games in my time but I'm glad this one is one of the ones I've tried so far.  The puzzles are fairly-straight forward and even addicting to solve, also has a nice engaging story-line and characters, even really creepy at times. There's a lot of replayability to get all of the endings (I felt fine with the 2 that I got after replaying once & looked up the rest) and the 1 achievement you can get. If you're any kind of a VN fan or maybe even Undertale fan, I'd reckon this would be up your alley.

																This is easily one of the best rpg maker horror/adventure games I have played. I would describe this game as how it would feel to spend all day at an art museum and then come home with a fever. This story and world would be the dream you would have that night lol. I love both art museums and these kind of rpg maker games so I am a bit biased, but I highly recommend it. The puzzles are all simple enough to complete without a guide while still being mostly fun. The music is surprisingly good too. I ended up going for all the endings. There are quite a few. I only needed a guide to get the true ending, which is my only criticism. Its a bit strict to get it. But the other endings are also worth getting and easier to get.

																I played Ib like 8 years ago, and it still lingers in my memory as a well beautifully written rpg horror game. It’s perfect for people that enjoy games like Mad Father, Okegom games, Witch’s Heart, and Yume Nikki. If simple pixel art style isn’t something you are familiar with it’s definitely worth to give a shot with this game since it also has short gameplay but despite that it masterfully builds tension and delivers a immersive world that’s as emotionally impactful as it is slightly creepy. A must play classic for indie horror fans. Buying it and replaying it has made me wish it got the same treatment as Angels of Death and got an anime adaptation

																Ib was my intro to RPGMaker horror 10 years ago, and it's been a favorite of mine ever since.  The game itself is definitely nothing horrifying, but that's not to say there aren't moments that spook yaIt's easy to play through in a couple hours even if you take the time to backtrack and explore everything. I am able to play through several times and get every available ending in a dayI love the art style and it's simple, straightforward story makes it easy to follow. Some basic puzzles help keep players engaged throughout the game. It's a great game for folks who are just getting into horror, or even just folks looking for something that's short and sweet

I finally was able to get the game myself a while back and I've started playing through the game myself. This game and the game Mad Father both stick in my mind as games that are necessary owns in this similar type of game vein.

An RPG maker puzzle classic; I'd absolutely watch an anime if it got oneGreat game, not too long, but plenty of bonus content for those who want to get more out of this game, my only real criticism is some cutscenes could do with a skip option after you've seen it once or twice, since multiple playthroughs is required to fill the gallery (the only achievement this game has).I think this game could do with more achievements, even if all of them are just ones you'd unlock on your way to getting the only achievement the game has, but I don't think it's really the focus of the game, it doesn't detract by only having 1 achievement, it's just fun to have more to work for, or to have those little milestones along the way as you go for the main one.the music is great, and the art, which is important considering the entire game takes place in an art museum, I feel like there's some yume nikki influences here too which is always a plus, it's great as a fan of yume nikki to see where it's inspired other works, there's great atmosphere, the characters are alright although honestly I felt it could've perhaps done with a couple more, but there are benefits to a limited cast I suppose.I did notice a couple typos in my playthrough, but nothing that'd be an issue for understanding puzzles or anything, it's not going to ruin your experience with the game and they're pretty few and far between.I haven't played the original Ib so I don't know how it stacks up comparatively, or whether what this version adds is substantial enough to pay for, but I enjoyed it, I'll probably give the original free version a go since I enjoyed this one so much.also I want to add, at points the music made me reminiscent of some of the music in LiEat, so if you were a fan of this game's soundtrack perhaps you'd enjoy LiEat, although I realise this game's is a bit more atmospheric and tries to lean more into ambiguity and an eerie feeling, both are good but they both attempt to do different things, so it's not one to one the vibe is different between them despite the similarities, but nonetheless, maybe a good option if you enjoyed the music of Ib.Update: I've since played the original Ib and this one is betterIf you preferred the original, I totally get it, it goes more for atmosphere and claustrophobia, and yeah, this game does lose a bit of that, you have the option of a more zoomed in camera, but no one is gonna use it, and it's too zoomed in even if you did want to.The original Ib isn't as good in the ways of the art or the puzzles, not to say they're bad or anything, but this one just does it better in my eyes, there's a lot less room for misunderstanding with this version, the rough spots are fixed, and there are even points where this one gets the atmosphere better, for example the room full of paintings of a lady, the original just tries to unleash them all on you, and it's more annoying than tense, this version only releases a couple to keep you on your toes, and then there's 1 which is an actual threat during the chase sequence, there's less room for error, getting trapped by a dozen ladies in a painting, it's more straightforward, but just as -if not more- tense.If you preferred the original Ib, I totally get it, I think this version could do better at capturing the feeling of claustrophobia, or utilising darkness to elevate the atmosphere, but if you're going to tell me the original is the best way to experience Ib for any new player, you need to give them both a try again, and maybe get 2 different friends to try one and the other, have one start with the original, and one start with the remake, and hopefully then you'll get why this one is just a better and more well-rounded experience. Having a preference is fine, but you've gotta be realistic when it comes to player experience.

																An absolute classic among rpgmaker horror games. 100% worth checking out for any fans of short horror/puzzle games who somehow aren't familiar with this game yet.I already knew this game upon its original release back in the 2010s, but I never beat it on my own because I was a scaredy cat (and a child, to be fair). I still am a scaredy cat, but I finally managed to beat it with the power of friendship (voice chat).Also, my memory might be failing me here, but I am under the impression that the remake improves upon many aspects of the original game, such as the character portraits, spritework, and puzzles. There is a good selection of new localisations too, and new game+ features such as new endings and artworks to discover that I have yet to check out.

																The original is one of my favorite games and I've played it countless times the last 15 years. The Steam version has changed a few of the puzzles and areas, but I don't mind. It's mostly the same, and a fresh way to experience this brilliant game. The achievement for finding the 150 art pieces adds a fun challenge too. I would perhaps have wished for more achievements for each different ending, for completion's sake.

																Amazing classic RPGMaker horror. This rerelease adds a sense of completionism and lets you get the most out what's easily the best of the best. The added bonus dungeons, too, are just more of what's so enjoyable about the game. Short, bittersweet, and leaves you with an appreciation of the arts. (And Garry.)

																Ib is a fantastic game. The characters are great, the little details are amazing and so well made. The story is interesting, the world is deep and suspenseful, with just enough mystery to keep you thinking what is going on, it's fantastic. I recommend this game whole heartedly. I have many thoughts on the game, and if steam reviews could be super long, I would explain every section that mattered to me, but I can't and if I can't I don't want to just explain the beginning or the middle or the end, so instead I'll just say this: Play the game please! It's very good! Even though this remake removed quite a lot of content from the original, I believe that didn't ruin the game at all, it only made it more streamlined. My advice if you're on the fence? Play this game, support the creator. Ib is a fantastic game and story. It's a classic for a reason. We need more games like this in modern day. Play Ib if any of this sounds good to you, the game is great.

With a lovable cast of characters, a neat art style, and a wonderful soundtrack. Ib was an amazing game, a solid 9/10, also "Garry gave me a Fwench Fwy"

																Probably my favorite game, alongside UNDERTALE.Beautiful story, beautiful music, and beautiful characters. This little haunted gallery really makes you want to explore and get to know more of it. Also, as an artist, you can easily relate to the love Guertena put into his paintings, and how sometimes you wish your creations could come to live too.It feels so nostalgic.

																I really loved this game, I wanted to play it since I was 6 and when I was finally able to play it was so fun seeing the different puzzle and colors and it definitely implemented the fact that the main character is young so she is still learning words which is a nice detail for sure. the fact that your health is a rose is even cooler because then it actually has more like felling of ''oh hey, yeah, that makes sense.'' type thing. The different endings are also really cool to. All in all people really need to play this game, super fun, really interesting, very time consuming, in a good way, and the characters are really cute and the art style is super nice.

																I discovered Ib only this year through another game that had a collaboration with it. I liked the vibe of that collab, and it intrigued me enough to finally check out Ib for myself.As someone who hasn’t played many games of this style—aside from Undertale and a few others—I found Ib to be unique and engaging in its own quiet, eerie way. At first, I felt that going through the entire in-game gallery and interacting with every painting was a bit tedious; there were moments when it even made my hand hurt. But the atmosphere, the vibe, and the overall experience outweighed the simplicity of the game’s controls.For me, the biggest highlight of Ib is the sense of exploration—and the tension of constantly being on edge, waiting to see what might happen next. I’ve only played through the game once and got a good ending, but I know there are multiple endings and more content to discover in future playthroughs, which I’m looking forward to.I usually like going into games blind (aside from what I picked up through the collab), and I prefer figuring things out on my own before diving into the lore. One detail that really caught my attention (spoiler alert) was how both Ib and her mother resemble the mysterious women in Guertena’s paintings. It made me wonder if there’s any deeper meaning, or if it’s just a coincidence—but that kind of open-endedness is part of the game’s charm.To sum it up: gameplay-wise, it’s simple, with some satisfyingly tricky puzzles along the way. Story-wise, it’s mysterious, atmospheric, and leaves room for personal interpretation. Definitely worth playing if you enjoy slow-burn storytelling, exploration, and eerie puzzles.

																Very nice game from the classic RPGMaker era.Puzzles are mechanically simple (find correct key/item and use it on the correct spot), but there's a mysterious atmosphere that makes you always wonder "what's coming next".A few jumpscares, but most of the horror comes from the uneasy feeling the art gallery offers. It's still rather "light"; there are only a handful of "enemies" which can be avoided easily. There's a couple rooms that are really tense, and in which failing IS an option. Considering there are several endings, keep that in mind as you save your progress.Overall, scary ambiance, interesting visuals and puzzles, and a very short length (finished in 2.3 hours for the main story, I'd wager to see all the endings it'd take 3-4 hours more). So if you want a horror game you can finish in one sitting, and/or miss the good old RPGmaker style games, go for it!

																Light puzzles and a very cool dark-sweet atmosphere. I like the game and I see great potential in it - however, this noticeable note of Fanfic - in my opinion, a little spoils the work as a whole.The 'team' focused too much on the events between the characters not on their development and personalities, moreover, the whole leitmotif of the game with the paintings, the painter went to the background. Still, as a work from 13 years ago in RPG maker it's pretty decent and have its charm!

																Honestly, this is a cool, little nifty game for such a price, although if you speed through it, it's relatively easy to complete, hell, even 100%, considering my first playthrough was roughly 30 minutes.Although.. How the hell did the parents not question where the hell their daughter went?that's my only nitpick with this game. Otherwise, just get the game on a sale.

																Having played the original version years ago, I always wished at one point or another to re-experience the game. Both in it's unique thematic of a "cursed gallery" along with how sweet, creative and lovely this Horror/Puzzle RPG Maker adventure game ended up becoming. The Remake gives a bit more "polish" to it with new graphics, enhanced visuals, some small surprises and the added features from the patched version of Ib. Still the same experience, and not as long, but a very sweet weekend game. From the visuals, the short sweet and spiraling story, the characters short but impacting segments and most of all the ambience and music make this game a bonafide experience that solidifies as a classic in the genre. Now, please enjoy the game: Welcome to the World of Guertena.

																Ib is probably one of my top favorite horror RPG's. I remember watching it as a kid and wanting to play it someday when I got my own running PC and here I was at last to do so, in a newer version of the game, which I'm okay with truthfully because it keeps true to the original and everyone just looks amazing.I ran through this game with much love twice on Stream and got the Neutral & True Ending (Plus the Bad Ending too) and I wish to achievement hunt this game to complete the gallery in all its nice glory and see the gallery in full view of paintings.Game itself was well versed, the puzzles kept me curious and thinking, Garry and them looking amazing in upgraded graphics, music and art were so amazing from the OG. Plus extra secret dungeon was also a nice addition! 10/10 game if you wish to check this out!=Although I am wondering about a supposed Secret Ending known as the Sacrifice Ending, it follows the same line as Promise of a Reunion but before the ending bit, your able to bypass and allow something to change. But when looking into it, I was unable to find how to actually get it and or if it's in the remake itself or in the OG. I was hoping to grab this Ending too! If anyone has ideas on how to get this ending or if it's in this version, please lemme know ^^

																Ib is a very short and cute little game. one of the staples of the RPGhorror genre.you play as little 9-year old Ib (pronounced "Ebe" (probably meant to be Eve?? but Japan doesn't have the letter 'V' to it turned to "Ebe")) exploring a spooky little art gallery filled with not very friendly paintings and artworks. The puzzles you have to go through are fairly simple yet still fun to solve. soem can be pretty head-scratching too.the background music is eerie and sets-up the game's atmosphere nicely.the pixel art and character portraits are well-made and unique in it's own right. Though the game has "horror" as one the tags, it's really not that scary. But i don't really see that as a negative. it just means it's more accesible to folks who may not be all too fond of jumpscares (speaking of which, there're like, 2 jumpscares at best in this game. The horror mostly comes from the unsettling imagery depicted through it's simple pixel graphics.The story itself is very simple and cute. it has it's moments, some twists and turns, but overall i'd consider it pretty average amongst other 2D story-based pixel RPGs with hints of depression™. I'd put the story to be on par with Mad Father, but sliiiiiiiightly lower. by a veeeeery small margin.idk how this game is priced in other countries but i'd definitely recommend picking it up when it's on sale.7.9/10 game very cute and simple.

																Ib's exquisitely simple narrative makes this game an instant classic, with all the qualities of a perfect fairy tale. Gorgeous & thoughtful; thought-provoking, yet without pretentiousness. This is a child-safe horror game with heart. This game is three and a half hours long, yet absolutely unforgettable, with a character or two who may never leave a warm corner in your heart.Ib is easily one of the best free games ever created, and infinitely worth the cost when you take this remake's graphics into account. I'm also happy to pay for a piece of art that deserves to exist.

																I've absolutely adored this game ever since I was a kid, and I CANNOT recommend this remake/remaster enough honestly.  While I do have a few tiny nitpicks (puppet being cut from the ost, the sketchbook feeling a bit emptier than the original, less chase sequences) they pale in comparison to just how great the game still is and all the QOL changes the remake has.  Absolutely love having the option to talk to Garry at any time, both for ending purposes and just to spend more time with him cuz he rocks.  The map in general had a massive facelift and it's definitely for the better, everything just flows WAY better than it did before and when comparing it to the original it shows.  I do think the sketchbook loses a bit of it's creepiness from this but it's far from a deal breaker in the grand scheme of things. Everything is streamlined while still remaining super interesting and keeping the charm of the original. There's so many other subtle but amazing changes that I adore, I really hope kouri ends up making another game some day because his style is absolutely amazing.

																best ever game i literally would die for garry. worth all the money ever, played the free version first and it made me appreciate this version even more. got it on the switch too. honestly a key experience if u like games like the witch's house, or corpse party, or yume nikki, or any RPG maker horror-adjacent game (also games like undertale). this is a staple to the genre. more uneasy than outright scary, appreciate it more for the story than spooks for sure. additional content to unlock after beating the game for the first time, so there is definitely replay value.

If you dont like games that have wierd puzzles then this might not be for you but if you do or just dont care then this game is a solid game to try out.

																Rating 8 of 10Product received as a gift■ I wish it was longer, I finished the game 2.5 hours and several minutes to replay and getting some other endings■ I don't like the concept of re-playing the game to get new level or new content, I'd prefer another DLC story■ The story is so-so, that's okay because this is not a story focus game. However I like the concept of it.■ The art gallery feature is great, giving me PS1 or PS2 vibes, where dev really care about the assets they made and showcase them to user after unlocking it, just like PS1 or PS2 era.■ This game also giving me goosebumps, even though there's no real scary or horror assets the music, the vibes the concept giving me goosebumps, I give 10/10 for the amosphere this game gives.

I like the new graphics and new puzzles, but my favorite feature is probably being able to talk to Garry (and/or Mary, my favorite character) in the overworld. The additional dialogue is what really completes this remake for me.

																Ib is a very classic indie horror game that, in my personal opinion, is what possibly was the first step to making indie games a good market for gamers out there. While it is very short in time length if you are familiar with the game, the fact that it still feels like you can come back to it to enjoy the story, the characters, and the scares really says something about a game that, while being a remake, originated over 11 years ago of this review and can still be talked about to this day. If you are really interested in one of the first best indie games that came out so long ago, then by all means, give Ib a try. Oh, I also hope you enjoy the art and it can create tickle your creative brain, especially those who like abstract art.

																I was hesitant on buying this game since I didn't enjoy it when I first played the original when i was a young lad (2013, I was hella smooth brain, I even ate crayons...) but now that I'm older I can actually appreciate, immerse myself into this game properly, and actually figure out the puzzles without help as well, hell I even enjoyed solving them.If you missed out on this game way back then or just want a short little adventure game with some spooks and scares here and there, I urge you to give this game a shot. It's short, charming and has a lot of heart and soul put into it.Either way I loved the whole journey I spent trying to figure out and 100% this game. I loved the time I spent with the characters and I wish the game was longer so I can spend more time learning about them.10/10, Best art gallery I have ever went too. <3

																Ib is a very simple yet effective game.It’s your classic RPG-maker game with multiple endings. What makes it stand out from the rest is its undeniable great atmosphere. A very dark, moody with a creepy setting (abandoned art gallery), great music and a mostly silent protagonist gives this game a uniquely creepy atmosphere. It’s also very beautiful - the characters are drawn gorgeously and the artwork is unique and pleasing to the eye.The puzzles, which make up the majority of the gameplay are all fun and logical. I never had to look up anything which is great. The horror is very light in this game - I wish there was a bit more but I do appreciate the horror not being over the top. It was uniquely integrated into the game.Overall, a short yet very pleasant gaming experience for me. I recommend this game.

																I've played this game more times than I can count, I was first introduced to this game when it first became popular when Pewdiepie played it. This was the first RPG Horror Maker Game I played and had downloaded over RPGMaker.net which also introduced me to The Witches house and the Hanged Man series. That series and the game, The Witches House, are amazing games and if you liked this game and wish to play another like it than I recommend going to play those. The Steam version of this game has very smooth gameplay. The extra ending(s) and the gallery you gain after your first gameplay, you can not get with the downloadable version on RPGMaker.net. I recommend buying this game for the bonuses found after your first gameplay but if you want to save money go and download IB at RPGMaker.net.

																A short, cozy, and charming RPGMaker classic. The idea is fun, the characters are sweet, tunes fairly catchy, and its world is fun to explore. The horror it has isn't jumpscares or hyper realistic eyes/blood, but all in it's atmosphere and world which I think it does well. Multiple endings too so it'll keep you occupied for a bit.

																Let me  say, the music in this game is rather good. I didn't expect it to be such a strong highlight. but was pleasantly surprised; I went into this game thinking, "okay, this could be interesting", and was taken aback by the varied (yet simplistic) branching narrative paths. After finishing the short (4-6 hours) play through, I found myself compelled to dive back in, and collect all the paintings. It took roughly 4 playthroughs for me without a guide, which pushed my play time more realistically to 12-15 hours or so? I would be extreeemely remiss not to mention the puzzles. Some puzzles were simplistic, easy, but had fun and unexpected resolutions which kept things fun. Other puzzles were creepy, or complex and made me feel engaged. In any case, exploration is rewarded, thought provoking puzzles keep it fun, and the narrative and music are pretty good - with the music being stand out. This remake of the original really delivers.

																I remember the original Ib. I was young and my sister found it and I didnt even play it until I watched her beat it like 3 times. Even then after I did finally play it for myself it stuck with me forever. Most people say the games that stuck with them are Mad Father, A Witches House, Yume Nikki and I could go on, but for me it was this game. It always made me feel something new when I replayed it and even now with this amazing Remake that I 100% on both pc and switch it makes me feel something. I love Ib and the way they make her feel like a real child in this situation, Garry who is dumb, but kind doing anything he can to help Ib and Mary who I hated my first playthrough years ago I later liked the mosty cause even when you first meet her you can tell something is off and to see her loneliness especially with the new endings they added are just amazing.

																I absolutely adore this game. I feel like it's an essential when getting into RPGmaker horror, alongside Corpse Party, and has been one of my favorite games since it came out. This was my first time playing the remake and I fell in love all over again. It's short and sweet and has great replayability since there's like several different endings. The soundtrack is iconic and I still listen to it to this day, Mary's Theme in particular has sat with me for years. It feels obvious to say the game feels interactive and lively when the main premise is about works of art trying to attack you, but I don't know how else to describe. I love the little details when you interact with the different pieces, the world of Ib definitely feels immersive. We only get to really know three characters, one of them being Ib who is the player character, but the personality both Garry and Mary have never get bored. Especially now that I am already I have a greater appreciation for Garry, who has always been a favorite character of mine. When I was younger, I always felt like he was cool and collected and knew exactly what he was doing, but playing this now, I realize that Garry was just as afraid and lost but kept on a brave face for Ib. Mary is a character I could talk about forever, but I am glad people sympathize with her more. I still have no clue how people despised this nine year old lol. The dialogue that comes from these two characters never gets old and, even though it might not be a lot dialogue, fleshes out them out a ton.Phenomenal game with phenomenal art, music, and characters. I can not recommend this game enough.

																One of my favorite RPGMaker games of all time. Is it because I'm viewing it through the lens of nostalgia, and would I prefer other games had I played those when I was younger?...Maybe...?I'm just telling it like it is, though. It's got a cool story, with some replayability due to the several endings you can go for. I listen to this game's soundtracks pretty regularly and it really brings me back. It's a bit reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland, not so much for a sense of absurdity but more so for its really eerie and uncanny atmosphere throughout.

																The game's highly creative visual aesthetic, coupled with the similarly creative use of its art gallery setting, make for a truly fulfilling and unique world to explore, made even better due to its likable characters, gripping plot twists and intricate puzzles. Its only downside comes when trying to unlock all of the game's artworks and other endings, as the extremely specific requirements for some make the process a bit of a frustrating chore. Nonetheless, all of its storytelling and visual prowess make for a game that fans of the genre should check out. (8/10).

Usually its so boring and feels like a chore to get all endings, but it was just so interesting, i needed to see all the artworks. I would love to know more about Guertena, all of his work really is art, I found myself looking at the true exhibition many times just thinking about the meaning to the story and the meaning over all of the different works. GREAT GAME!!!

																I love this game so much. I have been playing Ib since I first found it on an rpgmaker site years ago and now I finally own it on steam! So happy, it's enjoyable but also kind of upset that there is only a single trophy for this game, especially since there are a total of around 7 endings and a few hidden secrets. But overall so happy to own it again

																A friend recommended me this game after seeing I played other RPG Maker games in the past, and it was a pleasant surprise.It's a really short game, you can beat it in 2-3 hours depending of which ending you are aiming for. But if you really liked it you will spend some more time getting all the endings and finding all the artworks. The atmosphere is really good, by far the best thing in the game. I didn't expect this type of game to scare me, but I had this unnerving feeling everytime I replayed it.Also, for some reason, this game makes me feel nostalgic, despite never playing this game, the freeware version or any other game of this genre before.

																Short story with seven endings. I was a fan of the original and this remake is a more polished version, though some changes leave me a bit sad.  Do not go in expecting some big plot like other rpgmaker classics(i.e. Mad Father). I'm also sad that there's only one achievement for it. Do I think it's worth the price tag? Eh... not really. But I think both the free version and this remake are solid choices if you want to play Ib.

It has good writing, good characters, and a good environment. I'm a little sad that we lost a few rooms and puzzles, but its still so nostalgic, and deserves the overwhelmingly positive that it has.

																Let me start by saying that I am 57 year old first time gamer. I recently paid to have my oldest's Omen to be refurbished, and thought I should start. My youngest recommended Ib as a good starter game. I also like scary games. (I do like watching play throughs on YouTube- like Jacksepticeye and ManlyBadassHero). The puzzles are challenging, yet solvable and very clever. I like the world that the story is in and I have had some scares and have been creeped out. Strongly recommend. Enjoy!

																While the free original is great already, this remake is amazing and absolutely worth it in my opinion. I recommend it whether you've played the original or not, as long as you like horror puzzle games! This game uses choices, even ones that seem unimportant, really well and each of the endings is interesting. The puzzles are very fun and creative while usually not being too frustrating, and the improved art and animation is lovely. You might need a walkthrough for the endings at some point, since some of them have pretty specific conditions.

																There's no way I could succinctly describe how this game has impacted me since I first saw a play of it on YouTube years ago. The concept appeals to me as an artist, the characters are enjoyable, the art in game is genuinely fun to look at, and I like the music. The main story might be short if you know what you're supposed to do, but the post-game content (which is new to me!) is fun to find.

																For being my first 2D, Horror game, this is a really great game and worth at least trying out. Even thou it may be short, the gameplay, puzzles & multiple endings make up for it.If you are going for all achievements which there is only 1, have fun looking for all the paintings! That's the only hard part I would say if you're Achievement Hunting.  (Never doing that again XD)10/10....would play again for Garry

It's still as I remember it, with some changes here and there, and some new additions. The art definitely improved from what it was years ago (althrough that was already nice on itself!), overal, very happy to play again.

I watched Markiplier play this on youtube when I was younger and have been forever obsessed! Not only is the game beautiful, but its soundtrack is as well. I have never been able to find a game quite like this (besides Fran Bow and Mad Father) that has such a interesting and unique story attached to it. Also the game having multiple endings is just the cherry on top for me, im a real sucker for a "Your actions will have consequences" type of game

																I loved this game when it came out over 10 years ago and I love it now. This game is haunting and intriguing. The music is beautiful. The characters are few but interesting little guys as well. The extra work that went into remastering and improving upon this wonderful game adds so much more value to the game, especially for those who remember playing it when it released in 2012.If you're interested in games that are a little unsettling or creepy but not graphic or gross, this game is perfect for you. It's got just the right amount of spookiness to it to make you jump or go :O but not enough for nightmares. The story is interesting and I can't wait to relive the entirety of it just as I did working to get all the endings years ago. My 14 year old self had the fattest crush on Garry and it honestly still holds up lol.

																While there is a numerous amount of horror themed adventure games made on RPG Maker, I’ve never been fond of them usually. There have been some good examples here and there, but more often than not these games leaned too hard either in pure tasteless jumpscare territory or were simply too poorly written, relying on shock value or extreme themes. Due to that, I had no knowledge of Ib when it became an extremely popular free game back in the early 2010s and would have not paid attention to this 2022 updated (and no longer free) remake, if not for catching a few streams and videos on it. I am glad, however, that other people promoted this little gem and that I got to experience it for myself.Ib is a short horror themed adventure about a little girl who finds herself in a strange world where paintings come to life. And as it often happens with these RPG Maker based titles, it avoids the combat completely, instead focusing on avoiding enemies and traps and solving problems and puzzles. There are no special mechanics like stealth here, nor are the puzzles usually hard, so the game focuses mostly on just delivering a good story driven experience with lots of small and huge variations depending on how you play. Nicely enough, despite having quite a few different endings, the game isn’t really focused on this aspect as well and as far as “unlocks” go, you only need to get a few of them, with the rest of endings only existing to provide an interesting reaction to your choices through the game and occasionally learn some little additional thing about the characters.Despite being a horror story and having some genuinely creepy ideas, the overall atmosphere of the game is more reminiscent of a darker folk tale or something one might expect from Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There. Which works really well and completely avoids the typical for these games issue of going for the gore or overdone tropes. Most of the puzzles in the game, I’d even say all of the ones in the main playthrough, are really fun too. While the extended playthrough, that is available upon replays, has some weaker moments, it’s still really fun. The visuals and the music are also really nice and the simplicity of style works really well for the game.I really enjoyed playing the game and my only real complaint is that due to the engine choice and overall style, the game runs in a rather small resolution by today’s standards and can become less comfortable to run in the future as resolutions increase. But it’s a rather minor thing and I could easily recommend anyone who likes horror themed adventure games to check Ib remake from 2022 out.

																Ib is one of my favourite games ever made. I played the original release WAY back in the day and I've always held it close to my heart. The art is amazing, the pacing is *just right* and the puzzles are not too long or overly challenging. I'd consider Ib to be a comfort food game. It's an autumn evening game. It's short, the controls are simple, and the story makes me cry. Growing up, I had the hots for Gary, too.

																I played the original Ib often back when it came out. To this day, in fact, I have it saved on my computer. I had been a little hesitant to get into the remake, I will admit. I loved the original so much, it made me nervous to wonder what had been changed, but I didn't want to look it up. Of course, there was nothing to worry about.  Playing the remake was such an enjoyable experience. The changed puzzles had me captivated, the new art had me grinning, and all the new dialogue with Garry and Mary made my heart happy. Garry's part of the reason why I dye my hair purple, I'm not going to lie. This story holds such a special place in my heart, and I'm so glad to have the opportunity to experience it once more.

																This is genuinely one of the best games I have ever played. I've always been a fan of pixel RPG horror games but this one has quickly become one of my favorites along with angels of death (which I highly recommend you check out). Ib is a gorgeous game with beautiful art. It has amazing music and an interesting story line I can get stuck in for hours. The characters are well developed and interesting and all of the different endings are perfect each in their own way. I highly recommend this game! :)

																It was nice picking this up again. I remember playing it way back after seeing Markiplier or Pewdiepie picked it up. A small drive down memory lane until memory became cloudy.Turns out this version here on steam is a remake with some updates to puzzles and other things. I was a bit surprised, and I'm kinda wanting to play it some more at another time for the other endings, and maybe unlock all the artwork. It's still well intact with its pixel graphics, and the puzzles are still headscratchers for awhile until you start interacting with everything.I've enjoyed it.

																The true ending requirements are even more obtuse than the original. I recommend expecting to play the first play through without getting the true ending, and then re-playing the game to get the true ending by following a guide from the start.There is a bonus dungeon in this version of the game, but you can only access it on your second play through. This is frustrating, because the dungeon can be found in the final area of the game, so it seems to me like it would’ve been simple to make it accessible on your first play through.

As I mentioned in an email to you a long time ago, Ib is a unique 8-bit horror game with distinctive artwork and an intriguing storyline. It's the first game I ever played, and I purchased it at the full price, just as I  promised

																Ib is surprisingly creepy. The pixel art and sound effect work wonders in this haunted museum. We play as a little girl who accidentally jump into another dimension where she has to solve puzzles and such to escape. On her way she meets Garry and Mary, two people who are also lost in the same dimension as her.What I liked:* The pixel art animations are cute* The puzzles are easy to solve and satisfying to get through* The game is very intuitive. I never got stuck but I always felt challenged* There's not much of a story but I became very invested in the characters* There's enough health and save points to never get frustrating.What I didn't like:* I don't necessarily feel like playing through the game multiple times to find all the different endings. I'm happy with the super good ending I received, it's everything I hoped for.

																Very charming and interesting little rpgmaker game. Story-wise, you are trapped in an odd art museum. The main focus of the gameplay is puzzles, often related to the artwork featured in the exhibitions you'll see. By completing puzzles, you hope to break out of the museum. Ib has a bit of a horror feel to it, but I wouldn't call is a horror game. It's more puzzle, narrative, and choices matter. If you are a completionist this may be a good game for you, because you are encouraged to collect all the artwork featured throughout the game. There are also a good number of different endings. Personally I got the few that were easy for me to get without replaying the whole game and called it, but if going back and seeing how every option affects the outcome of the story is your thing, you can do that. I was a bit confused as to why the puzzles and overall environment existed at all, but the game was fun and charming enough I can overlook that small qualm. It's a good game!

																very classic game. i never had gotten the chance to play it, but i remember watching many people play it.the story is still intriguing even though i already knew what was going to happen, and i still love garry as much as i did several, several years ago.it is pretty short but there is the exhibition if you want to complete that. the updated graphics and small features are also quite nice.

																This is incredibly nostalgic for me. While I never got to play the original, I watched multiple people play this game when I was in my early teens. I was obsessed with the story and the characters stole my heart. This remake is incredibly faithful to it's predecessor and has a nice polish to it without taking from the original experience. I love this game so much, made it a personal goal to achieve the best ending, and felt as though I was reuniting with an old friend for a moment. Highly recommend even if you're not big into horror. This is definitely a great first step into the territory and I speak from experience saying that. Play this game at least once all the way through, I promise it's worth it.

																Being someone who went into this game blind, this is probably one of my favorite RPGMaker horror games of all time.It's chilling atmosphere and unique puzzles really sold me, but my favorite part about this game is its characters! Even though you know little about them, they leave a lasting impact. The game focuses less on the lore behind the museum and more on the characters, which is pretty refreshing. (I actually got the true ending first time around because I liked talking to Garry so much!)The gameplay itself was really fun. Ib really kept me on my toes! Of course the puzzles were a delight, but I enjoyed collecting all of the art pieces too! Plus, I love how your choices throughout the game contradict what ending you get, especially the doom counter. In most games your choices don't mean much until the end. I ended up replaying the game a LOT of times..I definitely recommend it!!

																This was a cute, yet creepy adventure.  There is no combat.  Occasionally, you'll need to avoid enemies.  Lots of puzzle solving, lots of collecting.The story is pretty interesting and actually gives the game a lot of replay value.  You cannot 100% the game without playing it a few times.  Luckily, you can skip any dialogue, but not scripted animations.  Lots of secrets that contribute to the player's understanding of what's happening.  Still, even if you complete and collect everything, it's up to you to mentally figure out what the deal is.Certain decisions affect the outcome of the game, while others merely affect what others say or how things behave or look.  There is a certain character whose fate depends on your decisions, as well as how good your relationship is with them.  The progress of these items is not shown, but is otherwise hinted at with different actions or dialogue.  It's a little complex, but nothing a guide wouldn't help with, should you wish to use one.Ultimately, this is a great game for completionists and those who are fans of creepy retro visuals and art-based themes.

From the puzzles, the story, and of course the characters that come to life in the work of the artist. Being able to play a remake of this game gave me nostalgia feels, while there are differences compared to the original. I'm glad to play this version of the game, so whether you go for the classic or the remake, I hope you enjoy the beauty and horror inside the gallery.

																Not much has changed story-wise from the original. The visuals have been improved, some puzzles replaced with simpler ones, there is a bunch of new dialogue for the characters, but the horror aspect has been toned down in favour of a more 'atmospheric puzzle game' feeling.Overall, not an extreme "remake" like The Witch's House MV or YUMENIKKI -DREAM DIARY-, but a welcome improvement anyway, if only because it evokes nostalgia.

																A horror game disguised as an artbook... or maybe the other way around?The remake mostly changed the room layouts along with some puzzles (mostly making them way easier and less scary), but not without their additions. Personally I find the addition of the chat button to be cute; it's not just a hint button but with it you can kind of learn more about their personalities. Wished it was longer and at least a tad bit harder, but I cherished every second of it, and some of their artworks themselves I find them worth the money, and also all the endings revolving poor Mary.

																Ib has always been my favorite RPG so I was so excited to hear it was coming to Steam. Playing it, however, is bittersweet. In many ways it's still the same game I know and love, but many things have also changed. I feel the original art style for sprites, roses, pause menu, etc was much more unique and pretty than its newer, rounder, and more modern art style. I enjoy the new puzzles it has to offer as well as the same beautiful soundtrack. I mostly just miss the old hand drawn looking aspect of the game. I still love this game though ❤️ 7/10

																12/10Timeless Classic RPG maker horror game. Ib was one of my first experiences with RPG maker horror, and it left a great impression on me. The game is typical maker fashion, with added horror elements. Ib has a lot of puzzles that are easy to solve if u just pay attention. It has multiple endings, with only 3 being "main" endings? The characters are Ib, Gary and Mary. These 3 have been around for like 10 years now. This remake adds a bunch of new things which I didn't expect, new sprites, new levels, redesigneed rooms etc. Kouri even added a button to speak with your party members, which is even more dialogue + lore. The "horror" aspect of Ib remains as it was 10 years ago, it's not scary for me, this is true even now. But what drew me in was the story itself. Emotional and unique. Overall very good remake, hopefully more people are exposed to Ib.

																Ib is the first real horror game I've had growing up and my favorite of all time. The original game held a special place in my heart and when it came to recommending new people into horror, I would always recommend this game first. Everything in it was brilliant at the time and breathtaking as a child, the puzzles, the horror, being on edge, the hints, characters, atmosphere, everything was so unique compared to other horror games. It was more of a puzzle game to be fair and dived into it's story and character development more than it's horror element but that's what also made the moments where there where horror hit and hit hard. I'll never forget the moment where I was alone as Gary and meet that stupid doll, the moment where I was alone with Mary but still felt mistrust against her before I knew of her true nature, and lastly when being thrown into that toy box and trying to escape for the first time. All these moments are deep in my memory and will stay there. Though the one thing that really made me stay in this game other than the horror aspects and the puzzles, was Gary and Ib. I've never before cared much for a pixel that much, Each interaction, each moment together, and finally the end where Gary remembers Ib broke me to where I cried tears of joy to see that he remembers everything they went to. i could never forget all the times I was scared but I could never forget the times where his beautiful Guitar calmed me in these moments, to give me strength to carry on.Now, does this extent into the remake? Yes but also no. I enjoyed the Remake and I spent 12+ hours getting all 150 artworks without looking online(or trying to). I loved more interactions with Gary, I loved the new visuals, and New Puzzles. Though I wish there was more. Once I was done with the game I felt accomplished yet still not whole... like there needed to be more added to call this a remake. It also didn't help that some of the puzzles where removed to make the game easier, which I thought was taking away from the original. Overall, the only complaint I have is that I wish that there was more in this game. Then again, I had that same complaint in the original but this is a remake... it desires more. Perhaps a sequel? Though I doubt there will be one. Perhaps do the same with Mad father or Witches house and have a harder difficulty in the game which adds a secret ending or a new room, that would honestly help but that is up to the creator. P.S.If you're the creator of this beautiful Remake. Thank you for bringing me back to my childhood, back to simpler times, and making it overall feel like a brand new experience. Even though I wish there was more as stated before, this is still a damn fantastic remake that I'd recommend anyone. This will always be apart of my Memories.

																AaaaaaaaaaThis game will always hold a special place in my heart. I played the original and I'm glad for this remake.A small but very memorable cast of characters especially as you observe how their behaviours and interactions are moulded by the circumstances of the gallery that makes you sorrowful when you realise after getting all the endings that that will all you'll see of them. Very sad.While the graphic upgrades are not as drastic as I initially expected, they are still a considerable improvement over the original. As for the gameplay itself, I do enjoy most of the changes and additons of some of the room layouts and puzzles, adding a little bit more depth to some of the areas (as well as new artworks) and simplifying some welcome aspects though for one I feel like the sketchbook part, while I do enjoy some of the changed bits has overall become too simplified and less challenging but maybe that was the intention. Another part is the doll room which in the original I could consistently find the key but in this version I feel like I fail more often than not.In any case, overall I still highly enjoy and will fondly remember the game and I'd recommend it to anyone regardless of their genre preference. Alas, I again still wish to see more of the characters but I'm still grateful for a loving remake after ten years.

																I've been in love with most of the immersion aspects of the game since the original release back in 2012. Although I've noticed some significant changes in this remake, it felt as if I was replaying my Ib experience only that Ib was a completely new and refined game. Overall the story is short, but has different endings and the experience is phenomenal.

																One of, if not the BEST RPG Maker series remakes. I've loved Ib since the og came out when I was a kid. When I learned that there was going to be a remake, I was ecstatic! The remake has better graphics, smoother gameplay and more lore added on compared to the OG. ALSO, YOU CAN TALK TO GARRY AND MARY NOW! I LOVE THAT!!!!!! I'm so happy they added more to Ib and gave it tons of love. This game is WORTH THE MONEY! Garry is Bae. Don't trust Mary. PLAY THIS GAME IT'S WORTH YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

																The gameplay is mostly walking around and solving puzzles. The puzzles are not very difficult. The only time I got stuck was when I forgot to pick up an item.The story is very good and the characters are compelling.I would recommend playing it 2 or 3 times. Anything beyond that gets kind of repetitive since very little changes in most of your choices until the end, you're better off watching a video of the endings you didn't get.Also, if you want to collect all the paintings make sure that you don't kill Garry after your first playthrough, since you need him to read out the titles that Ib doesn't understand.

																A classic, and for good reason! It remains spooky and charming even all these years later, and the puzzles are a good time too! The only problem is that I beat it pretty dang quickly, so it's a bit of a hard sell for 12 dollars if you're focused on a time:money ratio. That being said, I've watched playthroughs of the game in the past, meaning the puzzles were quicker than average, and there does seem to be a degree of replay value here. I know there are variations to the endings, and it seems like there's some extra content after beating the game. I'm gonna leave it for another time, though. Overall, I'd highly recommend it if you're wanting for an experience that sticks with you despite a short runtime. If it's on sale, definitely go for it. As I said initially, it's highly regarded for a reason, and it's still worth your time if you haven't been spoiled on it.

																Ib is such a masterpiece. The horror aspects, the atmosphere of the game. It really pulls your heartstrings as you feel for the characters involved who are scared and terrified of the situation they have to endure. You really don't need ultra graphics to make a quality game, and that's how RPG like games get right every time. The quality of the story, they way you can interact with the other characters that you've been stuck in this hellish like art gallery makes for an authentic experience that I personally love. I recommend the game. Nice work :D

																내가 해본 인디 쯔꾸르게임 중 가장 훌륭한 게임(투더문과 함께-- 투더문은 스토리가 아주 감명깊지). 예술성이 높다고 생각한다. 미술관을 소재로 한 점에서 그런 것 같았고 배경음악과 소재도 훌륭했다. 정말 한 가지 아쉬운 점이 있었다면 마지막이 좀 허무했다. 이 게임의 배경음악이나 예술성이 뭔가 반전이라든지 숨겨진 대단한 스토리를 기대하게 하는 것이 있었던 것 같다. 그런데 그런 것은 마지막에 의외로 없었다.

																I wanted to recommend yes in the first 10 minutes of game play.  Very enjoyable romp through an art museum with multiple endings (I will admit I'm not a completionist so I only played till I got through my first ending) for those who like playing in new game+ there are multiple opportunities to discover new things.  In my opinion $13 is a bit steep for the 3 hours it will take to play through the first time so I would wait for a sale.  Overall this game had me interested from start to finish and had some really great moments.

																I usually only buy games when they're on sale, but Ib is a very special case. I'm buying this full-price as payment for all of the original free versions of this game I've enjoyed playing over the years! I love Ib so much, and I love this remake version! It's familiar, but also fresh in a lot of ways. Well worth the time getting every ending and unlocking the full gallery.

																I have come to play this game over and over again. First when I was maybe 12 and had downloaded it off some sketchy site, then again when I had gotten a new laptop, then again when I had gotten a new computer. Finally, I played it again when it was released on Steam. Throughout all these playthroughs, I have never been bored. While most of the puzzles and story have been the same, I was never tired of it. This is seriously one of my favorite horror rpg maker games. This game has a special place in my heart. 10/10 everyone should play.

																Originally played this game back in Winter 2012 and it still remains to be one of, if not, my favorite RPG Maker game 10 years later.The features like the updated sprites are really nice and the the ability to talk with Garry (And Mary) is a really nice quality of life feature for those who are playing through for the first time.I think my only real gripe about this new version is the replacing of Mary's theme with a new track only because it was ingrained into my memory for so long that it threw me off when I heard the new track instead of the original midi song that was used in the original version. Despite that, it's still a good song nonetheless.

																The moment I mentioned I was gonna play this game, I had all sorts of friends pop out of the woodwork going "Ib?!?! OMG IB!!!!" and recalling stories of the olden days when they would skip class just to play Ib as a group. Wish I could have been there because this is a game worth being nostalgic for. As a horror game, it gets the atmosphere just right and the guitar music they chose for this game is perfect for that melancholy art gallery. Highly recommend if you're in the mood for a classic RPGmaker game.

Thankfully, I can now say this new version is just as enjoyable and engrossing as the original, even with some changes that make me miss the older game if only a bit. If you like whimsical and eerie pixel horror games, this one is worth every cent.

So Im really happy that it got released this year. The new Graphics are amazing, many things are waaay better, like the font, but also some puzzles got reworked and are better now. Only thing I dont really like, is the artwork you get, when finally read (the full Title) of every Artwork with Ib. Was a bit disappointing. But Im sill really happy that this game got a remake

																One of the best rpg maker games, is up there with the likes of "The Witch's House", "Yume Nikki", "Mad Father", "Misao", etc.The thing that separates this game from the rest is, that it actually has a good story that poses a very simple philosophical tesis, wich is "the world is a percieved world". Each character has their own interpretation of the world, and they percive it through their own posibilities, their own background and knowledge of the world.For example, Ib doesn't know many words, so her perception and knowledge of this world is very limited, and so will be yours looking it throug her eyes. It also has a commentary in Barthe's Death of the author, the "main villain" of the story being a painting and all, invites us to think the art as more than what an author can concive. This also connects with the world as a perception on the self, one then learns more about themself by the way they percieve things, and every character even the villain is in a journey of selfknowldege.The puzzles are also quite fun, even more so the new ones, the new area is fine if a little short, and the special room is one of the greatest additions to this game. It improves significantly upon the original, but it also censores some aspects, like the imagery of death and suicide in the final area, wich is a minor complain. I recommend this version to old fans of the original and newcomers, it is a great and thought provoking experience.

																One of the classic Indie Horrors of the past.While the remaster is effectively the exact same game there are some small changes to some areas/puzzles and the ending routes have been slightly tweaked around a new "mechanic" while still retaining the previous "checks" for endings.I will say however, the additional interactions between the characters with the new talking "mechanic" is quite nice, nothing too major, but it's sweet to see more dialogue between the leads.

																Another well known RPG horror classic. Gotta say, I really like on how they really went when the original was remade. If you really like the original RPG horror classics, this is what I recommend for others to play.

																Truly one of the most iconic RPG horror games out there. I'm so glad the remake is just as amazing as the original with little extra bits and pieces to make it somewhat different. Amazing story, love the scary atmosphere and the characters are still dear to my heart almost 10 years later since I first played the original game. Forever recommend <3

																I'm so happy I finally got around to playing this! I practically grew up with Ib and I have played it so many times in my lifetime. I was excited to play it again, and enjoyed the new puzzles and the new sprites and artwork, which are so much more expressive than the old ones. Plus there's an actual button to talk to Garry! Everything I've ever dreamed of. I was very glad to be able to play it with my controller, too.

																If I had to recommend an RPG maker game that's not Omori to someone I would recommend Ib :DWith this I'm not downgrading or comparing either games with one another, Omori is my favorite and Ib is a close second.The game goes in much deeper detail than most RPGM games, what with simple yet captivating graphics and with puzzles that are simple but straight to the point and don't take away from the story line.Only recently did I actually play the entirety of the game (by which I mean I got each possible obtainable ending and unlockable for the achievement) and I have to say I've fallen in love with it even more.The characters are likable and understandable, Garry being a perfect depiction of a devoted stranger turned friend in a tight situation, where his actions clearly show how caring he is of Ib (who knows knows).With as little spoilers as I can, I highly recommend this game to anyone that loves the RPG maker category, and especially to those that played them a while back when they were at it's peak. If you played Ib before (the free version) this Steam version is a subtle but appropriate and beautiful remake, with better graphics and certain gameplay values. ALSO, it serves as a 'thank you' and support to the maker, which I think is very well deserved.This game awoke a lot of pleasant emotions in me and I think everyone should experience them as well :D

																I've known about Ib since it released back in 2012 and, ho boy, this remake does not disappoint. Ib's wonderful plot can't be described without spoilers, and I urge you to play game for yourself. The game's use of dramatic irony cannot be understated, and the plot twists are twisty.I don't often cry to games/movies/whatever. In real life? I'm a crying little ♥♥♥♥♥. But games have to try hard to get me to cry. Ib succeeded, which I consider a major win for it's immersion. Little details, like Ib not knowing certain words because she's a young girl, make this game all the better.The remake itself is a major glowup. I've wanted to buy this ever since I found out about the remake before it released, but by the time it was localized to english, I didn't have the time (or the $13.00 to spend). This was worth every penny of tax Steam took from me though. It's such a short, simple game, but the puzzles are fun, and the story is genuinely incredible. (There is one gripe I have with the pacing, but I can't go into it without spoilers, so just know I acknowledge it.)Ib is wonderful, and you should by it.

																Really good horror/adventure/puzzle game with emphasis on solving creepy puzzles. This game was worth my time and it's worth yours. There are multiple possible endings. If you enjoyed the Team Silent Silent Hill games, you will probably enjoy this. It's not nearly as gross or depressing or even scary by comparison but you will get the creeps and you will have to run for your life more than a few times.

																I had originally played the 2012 version so seeing this amazing little game get a remake was heart warming. Some of the puzzles have been replaced or taken out (They were a pain in the original) I love how the only achievement for this game is finding all the art pieces. there are 150 in the whole game which sounds like a lot but its nothing if you have been looking at the paintings on the walls throughout your play through. Its a collectable trophy I didn't want to die getting. Of course the graphs look a lot better then the originals- which is nice because the text was kinda hard to read in the 2012 version but that problem is fixed in the remake ( CG's also look cleaner) The only problem I had was getting the "Promise of Reunion" I think this was because you have to talk to Garry a LOT you will be spamming E every where you go. You also have to make the right choices of course- Other then this my play through's were fun and nostalgic.In all I was super happy with this remake and seeing one of my childhood favourite games getting some love made me really happy.

The graphic had an upgrade, new content was added and overall the game gotten a new breath of life into it. What I appreciated the most was the simplification of communication with Gary and Mary making the achieving all endings simpler than the original. I ADORED that we were able to get to interact and know Gary more because he had always been a favorite of mine.

																As someone who absolutely adored the original to death, this was one of the best things I ever heard when I saw the steam remake announcement. Truly outstanding, I love the visual upgrades, the puzzle changes are fun even if a little less difficult in places (I don't mind at all!).You have a talk to Garry button, what more could you want?Played through it all to get all the endings and paintings, loved every step of the way again, 10/10

																Okay. I know only 0.5 hours on record BUT I played it when it was still an rpg maker free game. I am so happy I can see Garry again and love him like I always didWe STAN Garry and will do everything for him. This game may have founded a cult but I am truly happy to be a part of this cult that worships Garry

And I still have a crush on Garry, he's still wholesome and kind in my memory and the fact that this remake added a lot of his dialogue makes it even better! I also love the post-game extra content that is newly added in the remake, that area is just dang cool! and also collecting all the paintings makes it rewarding because of the achievement. Thank you for this amazing game, Kouri!

																A nice remake of the original, I'd always go back and replay the original just for fun since it was a personal favorite of the RPG horror genre for me. Now that there's this remake, it's a lot nicer to have a slightly more updated and newer version of Ib to mess around in. It sticks to its roots, and nicely adds some more stuff to it. Thanks for the nostalgia hit.

																I played Ib as a kid on rpgmaker, so seeing it come back alongside Mad Father and Misao is incredible. I loved playing Ib when I was younger, and I love the remake now! It's still got that soft, slow creeping horror that I adore, and the world is so vast and leaves you wanting for more. The endings and painting collecting gives an incentive to see all the endings to learn more, and the addition of content really makes it all the more sweeter a homecoming to this game. I'll easily play this game over, and over again whenever the mood strikes me.

																If I had to summarize my feelings for this game, Ib could be described as a horror rpg that is unique and is personally one of my favorite indie games to play. You take on the role of a girl named Ib, whom visits an art exhibition by the artist Guertena with her parents. It's not long after wandering into the gallery alone that Ib enters into another world and must pass multiple puzzles and countless killer artworks to escape. GraphicsFrom the beginning, Ib's graphics are absolutely stunning, with the game feeling very artsy yet having a touch of horror as the game's theme and genre suggests. Being a remake of the original game released in 2012, all of the graphics have been updated, including a major revamp of the character busts, the option to zoom into the game, and some of the obstacles/layout having been changed. Despite this, the game retains the aesthetic of the original in contrast to other remakes such as The Witch's House and Mad Father, which helps it give off the same feel as it's predecessor.MusicThere's not much to say about Ib's ost other than it is the same from the original. That being said, each song fits well with where you are in the game and it's cutscenes.Multiple ChoicesOne of the best thing about Ib are the choices you can make throughout the game that can lead to different endings. What makes Ib unique in this regard is rather than solely making choices to a certain ending, interaction with characters and the environment is also a big factor in what ending you get. This not only helps you get invested in getting to know the characters more and analyze your surroundings, but it is also something that helps Ib stand out as most games with multiple endings I feel only focus on doing a certain action or choice rather than taking advantage of the game itself. It really shows the potential of what doing or not doing can really have on a game.In conclusion, playing Ib was a fun experience that while lasting only a few hours, it really shows how much a single developer is capable of doing and how enjoyable a game can be despite it's length. Would definitely recommend to horror game fans and for people looking for something in the horror genre yet not too scary to make you jump out of your boots!

																Ib is a short journey, but its brief playtime means it doesn't overstay its welcome (for reference, at time of review, I have completed one of the endings. There is replay value here). It's sufficiently creepy as opposed to being scary. The updated menus and sprites are a treat to look at, and it's nice to see Ib's Parents this time around. Aside from the addition of a master gallery to track which endings you've acquired, however, not much seems to have changed. If you loved it then, you'll love it all the more now (which is why I'm excusing the high price tag on it-- I downloaded the original version for free years ago and fell in love with the game, and I want to see the developer hopefully make more. Thank you very much, kouri, for the experience long ago and the decision to remake it and make it available on Steam).If you've never played Ib before, I wholeheartedly recommend it. (3/5)

																ITS SO GOOD!! new puzzles and map changes from the original are added, and whilst it usually follows the normal story line, there is refined graphics, new monsters and also harder puzzles and the more horror feel of the game as it has quite dark light throughout! Some people may think it’s too like the original, but it’s not a new game altogether but a remake so you get what you pay for. The new puzzles are more complicated yet still somehow link to the old version, which is a very nice touch. 10/10!! i’d buy it twice if i could!!

																Ib is an absolutely excellent game. This remake touches up quite a bit of the game from the original and includes new features, including the ability to talk to your current party members. There is a surprising amount of new dialog for this feature as well. The puzzles aren't too challenging and if you've played other games made in RPG Maker you will not have too much trouble. The most notable part of Ib is it's story, which is the primary reason this game has stuck in my head for so long. The story covers many themes, including isolation, the power of fiction, and the impact of an artist's legacy and uses these themes excellently. If you remember watching videos of or playing the freeware version back in 2012, I would absolutely recommend picking this up, you may be surprised by what you find.

																I bought this game for the nostalgia. Ib is a very important game to me and a part of my childhood. This "Remake" improves the in-game sprite and puzzles. The translation is better compared to the old translation by vgperson, now he has improved it. Garry's manner of speech is more accurate compared to the old one which has been lost by translation. My only complains are the change of the art style in the character profile and CG, the older version had a more darker tone which is the kind of style I find more fitting with the haunted art gallery setting. The only times I feel threatened, in the game were the Woman in Grey and the Doll Room. The other creatures in the gallery are very slow compared to the original. This game is a classic with a very much alive fanbase and has stood the test of time. I highly recommend buying this game.

																Really good game, i went in knowing nothing about it except for the game description. I finished it once so far and I enjoyed it a lot so I'll probably try and go for some other endings. A lot of good work was put into this and I thought it was really well made, characters are good and I don't see many bugs or glitches. The music used in this game really suits it so that's a cool plus. The story is good too, it has good pacing and its just generally fun to figure out, but once you find out the most important part it feels like it goes by really fast. Other than that I thought the story and overall game were very good.

I think you are going to love it! Still have similar puzzles with the original one, but there're also the new puzzles! Which I think is not that hard but very enjoyable..

																Ib is yet more evidence that video games are a fantastic medium for storytelling. If you are looking for a horror game, you can find far scarier games, and admittedly, if you're looking for a good story-focused game, you could find better. But what makes this game good is the big picture. This game is a unique combination of things. It's eerie yet adorable. It's deep in it's own way, yet doesn't come off as pretentious. It's creepy, but not lonely. It has a small, yet lovable and memorable cast. For these reasons, I say that this is a fantastic "gateway horror game", for someone who is too scared to play things like Resident Evil or Silent Hill. The whole "RPG Maker Horror" genre can be considered great gateway horror games, but Ib in particular has something special about it. Unlike many horror games, RPG or otherwise, this game never kills you unfairly, and is really easy to boot. This was the very first horror game I ever finished, several years ago. This remake doesn't change a whole lot (although area layouts are different) but it gave me a reason to play through this great game again.

																Ib is a wonderful game, and this remaster retains just about all of the charm and spirit the original freeware version had. The game has been changed in a few ways, for example, some of the puzzles have been changed to be less annoying to solve. A change I don't really understand is why they changed Mary's theme. In the original, Mary's theme was probably one of the most iconic songs in the game, and the new version just feels bland and uninspired. That's the only thing I have against this version, everything else stays true to the original, and I can't recommend it enough. I haven't seen any post-game content yet, but I am hoping that it still stays true to the original.

																The original Ib released in 2012 was my first introduction to the RPG horror genre. Before this remaster was released, I must have played the original like 6 or so times out of both nostalgia and a genuine love for the story, characters, and art. This is the game that inspired me to learn more about (and eventually dabble in) game making, and Kouri's blog gave me some of my first resources to start that progress. I think it goes without saying at this point, but I was more than excited to see that a remake was on the way!If I'm being honest, I was a little worried that the major hype I had going in would make my expectations a little high- but *wow* was I wrong! The remake is a perfect blend of old and new, containing not only a polished new look but refreshing puzzles to keep it interesting for returning players. Oh, and I can't forget to mention my favorite non-spoiler part of the remake, the loads of new dialogue added to every single area of the game- really makes the whole game feel so much more personal and special.Whether you're new to Ib or a returning player, you're in for a treat. I hope you can enjoy this gem as much as I have!

																As many have said and agreed, this game is amazing, and is very much up to par with the original. I'm glad I've bought it, and it's not common for me to purchase remakes, but it was great. Especially love being able to talk to Garry whenever I'd like ^_^The only thing is, some of the puzzle additions made it feel like the game was shorter than the last one to me? It may just be me... The additions also felt easier. No spoilers but, only semi-difficult one I found myself awed with were the ones you may find in your second playthrough...I'm posting a late review...

																Ib is honestly one of those games that truly knows how to convey a story, the game is short as it only takes about an hour to complete the basic run and an hour and a half to complete the New Game+ but the replay value is what truly makes Ib what it is! With a multitude of different endings you'll find yourself going back for more each time you finish alongside that, you'll find that the characters also are easy to fall in love with and root for as well! In all seriousness if you have the time and money please play this game and fall in love with it just as many of us here have.

																I was thrilled to see this game finally make it to Steam! I love the original - it's one of my favorite games, so I was looking forward to seeing how it was updated. I love the improved character models and other graphics. Everything looks great. I also love how you're able to interact more with Garry and Mary. There are a couple of things that I wish wouldn't have changed, such as certain "scare" sound effects during particular events  (for example, for "Beware of Edges," I would've liked for the original sound effect to remain instead of there being hardly any noise; I think there was a missed opportunity in one area for a good startle) . Some of the swapped/new puzzles aren't my favorite, but these are just my personal nitpicks. It's a fun game and I really enjoyed playing the updated version. If you love the original game, you will probably enjoy this one, too.

																Finally I'm able to relive my childhood in a higher resolution. I cannot even put into words how much I loved this game as a child, and how much I'll continue to love this game as an adult. However, there was a few points of criticism that emerged during my time with this new version.At times it felt like the game was less scary than the previous version. For example, in the bride puzzle room, I remember the screen turning red and shaking when the painting chowed on the flowers, however it wasn't present in this version.The game also felt quite easy at points. In the orange area, the color-paintings could have been randomized to increase difficulty on subsequent playthroughs. Same could be said for the chest puzzle, and the bird, in the abyssal space.There were positive changes as well. The new puzzles were great. I liked the true exhibit. I feel it adds a lot of replay value. Controversially, I liked Mary's new theme. I felt the music had innocent and even tragic undertones,which probably make the reveal more shocking to new players. Mary's previous theme always felt creepy, which made the player anticipate for the reveal.Overall, I love this game. It's a unique masterpiece with amazing art. 5/5

																Ib is a legendary game that everyone should experience at least once. It's one of the most celebrated indie games of the 2010s, and arguably the absolute peak of the RPG maker horror genre. Although Ib always felt more like a creepy tragedy rather than a full blown horror game.The remake takes almost everything that made the original game good, and makes it even better. A few things are changed, the art looks better overall (if a bit less stylised) some puzzles are different and some new stuff was added. The big new feature is the talk button which adds a ton of new dialogue to the game and gives Garry and Mary things to say in each room, and even give hints for certain puzzles. Adds a lot to overall character development.Only complaint is that a handful of puzzles and areas were removed, which is unfortunate as it made the remake a bit shorter and easier. Also they removed the games most iconic song (Puppet) for some reason.

																Still one of my favorite games ever. As many other reviewers are saying... this remake is incredible because we can interact with Garry more. Story wise and all, it's very similar to the original game... although some puzzles and stuff were moved around in order to make the game seem a little more organized. I'd say it's worth it.

																The Ib Remake still offers that same endearing narrative experience to new players as the original and also makes a good number of changes to surprise older, more familiar fans.The art is as charming as ever, still maintaining the RPG Maker 2003 style while also adding details to sprites from the original. Kouri's new drawings for the game still keep with his iconic style from the original game. All of the art pieces featured in the game are now detailed enough to discern the subjects instead of merely representing a few pixels.The music still uses the iconic YASUPOCHI Guitar Diary arrangements from the original game. Despite the quality of the recordings, they still manage to fit the story beats well emotionally. A lot of the original music has been replaced and don't feel as iconic as their originals, but new additions also seem more appropriate for the narrative than the original's smaller soundtrack.Kouri's writing is still solid. The world of Ib definitely feels like fleshed out with moving parts, characters aren't flat and a lot can be discerned about them and the world they live in from dialogue and environmental objects. A new gameplay feature  that allows players to chat with companions outside of interactable objects  allows players to experience even more of this world building, with it being responsive to real time interactions with the environment or story events.The English translation was solid with minimal typos every now and then. The only arguable negative for this game is its relatively short length. This is, however, made up for in replayability: multiple endings and an optional collectathon on top of Kouri's writing makes paced and slower playthroughs more enjoyable.As a fan of Ib since its rise to cult internet status in the early 2010s, I played the original executable file from a thumb drive in elementary school. With its 2022 remake, I'm happy that Kouri can finally make a consistent profit from their most popular work.

(along with the fact that even if i try to find a good ib cosplay on insta most of it is artwork - edits) but still a good game all the same 10/10

																Short and simple but a great experience the entire way through, its a classic that I regularly recommend to people looking for new games, and I think it's the best gateway game into the RPGmaker horror, as well as being among the best of the genre itself. The characters are fun and full of heart, the world is dynamic and engaging, all the new content with the remake is fun to find and witness.

The original will always hold a special place in my heart, but this remaster brings some new twists and features to the game, so it's well worth it for new or old players to give it a go!The music and art is still top tier. I can't say much about the difficulty of the puzzles, since a lot of my knowledge of the original helped out, but with some of the new twists I did have to think a bit!

																This isn't much of a review, just an expression of fondness for this beautiful game.Loved this game back in 2012, and love it still in 2022.I prefer the original theme for Marry, and the Eerie tune played outside the staircase to marry's room, but I understand they were probably not usable for this release version, and the replacements are alright too.Very Happy that the little library movie book functions in this version of the game, adds an element to the experience I couldn't get out of the 2012 release from within the game itself.It's so nice to see this game again 10 years later, very happy to have been able to support Kouri by purchasing this game on steam. Thank you for releasing this updated version of Ib.It's always great to return to the world of Guertena!

																For the people asking if this game is worth buying if the free is still up; yes!There's some new puzzles alongside the old iconic ones, (imo the puzzles that got replaced will not be missed), updated art, more easily playable on more modern machines (gamepad/widescreen)  and the chatting feature to me is a lot more enjoyable than trying to interact with every wall or object. The free is also still definitely worth playing, even if it's slightly clunkier sometimes, so if you're on the fence, give that a shot! it is worth noting that as far as I'm aware there's no new endings, but the True Exhibit does have a small cute reward for completing it (which would require a couple runs to get everything and everyone)

																This is a very different kind of remaster than most of the other RPGmaker horror remasters that have been done.  Rather than just porting the original to the new engine with a few updates and changes while they're at it, this instead takes all of the stuff that made the original memorable and rebuilt the entire game focusing on moments like those.  While a lot of the scares and complex puzzles have either been simplified or removed, all of the art pieces, character interactions, and weird humor are still there with more added to them.  If you mainly liked the horror from the original then you might want to stick with that version but if you liked the story and environments then this is very much worth picking up.

																I'm going to try my best to be brutally honest here, only because I believe all new players and RPG horror veterans alike should understand what they are getting into when considering this version of the game.If, as of reading this sentence, you haven't played the original Ib, go do it. Now.The original Ib is one of the most, if not THE most, titular game of the horror RPG genre. It is compelling, scary, the soundtrack and characters are iconic and lovable in every sense of the word, and most impressively, IT'S FREE. You can go out and download it right now[vgperson.com] and get the same experience that this $13 Steam copy would give you, minus the redundant GUI changes and saddening puzzle removals.So, why am I recommending this game?Well, because I personally don't think this Steam version of the game is bad, but I also don't think it's anything new. My love for Ib and it's developers practically require that I throw my money at them, especially because the original is free and untouched from any new changes.Let's look at a game like The Witch's House compared to The Witch's House MV.The Witch's House was freeware which utilized default RPG Maker VX graphics, and, while dated, the storytelling and simple execution was done as perfectly as it was in it's newer counterpart. So why would I urge you to buy and play The Witch's House MV over it's original? The Witch's House MV not only completely overhauls the outdated graphics, replacing them with beautifully hand-drawn sprites, but rewards the player with a brand new difficulty setting as well, (in the same vain as Mad Father's remake) which expands upon the lore, what made these games so satisfying in the first place.What is different about the original Ib and it's Steam counterpart?(Spoilers ahead, by the way.)The UI for displaying your health is different (personally harder to differentiate). Some of the puzzles have been changed arbitrarily. One of the most iconic songs of the original soundtrack has been completely replaced, assumedly due to licensing issues. There is pop out sprites for dialogue now. A lot of the original sounds have been changed, more often than not to its own detriment (such as the roar when a painting or statue comes to life). The game looks almost completely identical visually. The way the game is now designed has, consequently, become less horror and more drama. The best thing I can give this version is the rework of the talking mechanic, along with a mass of new Garry dialogue.TL;DR Play the free version of Ib here[vgperson.com], if you haven't. If, afterwards, you want to support the developers, as I did, buy this game.

																I've been playing Ib for years~ It's always been my favorite game and I was HYPED to learn that they were remaking it!!! Now, years after my first playthrough, I just sat and played through 3 hours of this (and more to come) the second I got it, with my lovely Red Eyes doll sat in my lap, as she always is. It was a wonderful wave of nostalgia for me. If you've not played Ib before, I highly recommend it! If you have played it, you'll definitely love this!!! There's some new puzzles and the graphics are lovely. I enjoyed a lot of the smaller nuiances that they added. I love that you can just talk to Garry whenever, also. Made me happy. Still no "Take The Disturbing Doll" button, sadly. But I'll manage xDThis game will always have a special place in my heart <3 Now, ONTO COMPLETING THE TRUE EXHIBIT!!!

																I absolutely adore this game, without a doubt it is better than the original! I like that it keeps some elements the same and other stuff changes as you progress you can tell where things start of be a bit different, that being said its straight away different, with the main museum map having a new layout and some new dialog options for Ib's dad, new puzzles in the brown area and the yellow area (I especially loved the teapot puzzle) as well as some other goodies which I have yet to discover, I will continue to play this game until I get the only achievement for it so far.

I got into rpg maker horror stuff at a young age from watching youtubers and stuff play this game, and this game was by far my favorite! I am SO excited about the remake, it's honestly super amazing, way more polished, and really does the original justice! I was iffy about changing/updating the sprites at first tbh because the old ones were so amazing, but these new ones look fantastic as well! The pixel quality of them really looks fantastic. Tbh the visual aspect is what I'm most excited about because it is a visual game, but I'm excited about the updated puzzles, too! Not overly challenging, but they definitely feel more balanced than in the first game (I especially like how the yellow area was updated to have switches for the blue fruit plant instead of numbers for the door code). All in all, fantastic game, by far exceeded my already high expectations, and I'm just really really happy with how well it turned out :))

You may think it's not enough of a difference for it to cost money when the original was free, but frankly I believe kouri deserves the money from this game with how excellent it is.

																I'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stokedThis remake hit me out of left field. I've been obsessed with RPG Maker games ever since I played Ib back in 2012, it's introduced me to a whole genre that has been the foundation of a lot of my fondest memories. Ib really made me fall in love with RPG and, to a more specific but still somehow broader extent, horror RPGs. I can't understate the impact this game had on me. The recent remakes and re-releases of RPG maker horror games on steam like Mad Father and the Crooked Man has been an awesome. To see Ib finally get that treatment is a dream come true. A lot of the new content is great to see, especially the dialogues. I wasn't fond of the new puzzles that replaced the old ones but they grew on me, it's nice to not just be replaying the same game with a new coat of paint. This isn't really a replacement for the original, even though it is largely the same game. The original is still there to play. This game really is a work of art and my (second) favorite game of all time. I'm so happy to see new Ib content in the year of our lord 2022. Thanks Kouri, I love and worship you.I'll ♥♥♥♥♥ myself out for PLAYISM (now do OFF)

																If you like games in the puzzle genre I highly recommend Ib, it is as much a cleverly written Puzzle game with horror elements drawn in a sketchbook artstyle with charming graphics and characters. A classic RPG-horror game from 2012, Playism once again takes a popular indie project and remasters it with updated graphics and content.Buy this game and go through it blind, and after your first experience, I recommend searching guides to achieve the basic requirements for the true and extra endings. Being able to see the bond that grew between Ib and Gary again made my heart melt all over again. - 10/10

																An incredibly faithful remake! Successfully preserves everything that made the original game so good while overhauling the jankier aspects of certain puzzles- or introducing completely new ones in their place.After playing the game for a while and watching other people play the game, I had gotten so used to the new UI and text boxes that I was surprised to see just how different the game looks compared to the original, even though I barely even thought about it while playing!Overall, I'm very happy with this remake. This is the definitive way to play Ib. Worth the price tag.

																The same good ol' rpg maker horror game from 10 years ago. Some puzzles have been tweaked or changed outright, but those changes are mostly welcome. There are some new additions, too, and they're pretty fun. It's also a short game (I completed all the endings and the gallery in under 7 hours), but I think that's to the game's benefit. It's a classic, so if you haven't played it and have any interest in it then you should give it a shot.

																If you've never played the original, the game is worth buying not only by the fact that it supports the creator. But there is also a couple new endings, the presentation is generally better, and there is more characterization to characters having you enjoy them more. With the puzzles being better than the original.Ok, so if you've played the original Ib. Then yes, I can tell you that the game is worth buying. It's got all the extra content from the original Ib with an added "Press E for Banter" button, that way you can hear what Gary or Mary has to say. The endings also are a lot easier to get than in the original, but it still has a similar style which has the game checking if you've done certain acts in certain amount of times.

"short but sweet", i'd say.if you are worried about jumpscares, the ones in here, if you can even call them that, are very, very mild. trust me, i'm a super weenie baby when it comes to jumpscares and i didn't get startled once. no screamers or anything like that, which i appreciate.

																Ib is a simple but compelling experience that embodies some of the more subtle aspects of what I love about games. I played the original years ago as a free, RPG maker game. This version features the unique aspects that made the original so iconic as well as new details that are sure to be enjoyed as well.This experience is defined by completely original, pixel-based artwork. Each one is different and manages to leave a lasting impression on the viewer. From insect specimens, to abstract sculptures, and very many paintings, you will get the unique chance to see all of these pieces while exploring the mysterious, living gallery of the fictional artist Guertena. Meanwhile music serves to communicate the mood of the gallery very delicately while still keeping you entertained. You will be relaxed, amused, and very intrigued by what you see in this very special game!A small note for players who played the original, this game will feature new puzzles and artwork from the original. Most of the experience has been preserved, but some minor elements have been replaced. All of the endings have been kept in this version, so see if you can still figure out how to find them!There are few games as humble as this one that manage to keep your attention, so I highly suggest you purchase it and find out for yourself!

																The original held a special place in my heart and mind, I actually went back and re-played the original when I first heard the news of the remake release approaching to have a good comparison and familiarize myself with the world in depth again!The remake takes that original and enhances it wonderfully! The additional features (conversations with your traveling companions especially was my favorite) the rework of existing puzzles, the addition of new, the ability to view the true gallery from the title screen once you beat the game, all fantastic!!!This is a wonderful update and re-release of a beloved classic.

																I've been playing and thinking about the original Ib for AGES! Ever since I discovered it, it's inspired me. And the remake is taking me right back to those days. It's an improvement on what was already basically perfection, with new puzzles and new dialogue and more time spent with everybody's favorite purple-haired guy. I love this game more than I can ever say. It's one of my all-time favorites that I'll come back to again and again and again. Really, I couldn't recommend it enough. Thank you for this masterpiece, kouri.

																If you love sprite based rpg horror games I don't have any I can recommend with higher praise than IB. Its a concise story that unless you've played through a few times and know how to do it perfectly you'll have your heart strings pulled on. Noting my username is Guertana a play on the in game artist Guertena I've loved Ib since its original RPG Maker release and this release is just that and more.

Some things are a little switched around and different, but I loved all the new puzzles and the new dungeon area! The new art is gorgeous and the music made me nostalgic. Can't wait to replay this one just as much as the original :)

																The first RPG Maker game I ever played, now remastered. A puzzle/exploration experience in a surreal art gallery. Playing through the story doesn't take very long but there's tons of hidden secrets throughout all the endings. And exploring each little moment can give you a lot of insight into the characters and what they've been through.The art-style is charming and the overall art gallery theme works really well, both with the horror and puzzle elements. Anyway, the game was great in 2012 and its still great.

Rules of the Art Gallery    No loud conversation.    No photography.    No food or drink.    No touching the displays.    No fountain pens.    No leaving ever.Ib is an absolute classic of its genre and one of my personal all-time favorite games. It's clever, has a great atmosphere and is incredibly memorable. It is a short horror game in which a girl tries to escape a creepy gallery full of living artwork. The variety in concepts used in this gallery and the particular ways in which they spring to life is one of the main appeals I found in it, from creepy to funny to sweet to just, well, clever. It's cast is tiny but interesting and likable, the deadpan, brave little Ib, the soft, gentle and protective Garry and the cheerful but lonely Mary. These characters have stuck with me for years despite the little time the game gives itself to show you what they're about, and the origin of some of them remaining a mystery people still theorize about.  In terms of the remake's changes to the original, the new art is wonderful, showing even more of the characters' personality and detail in the gallery's artwork. The new and replaced puzzles are friendlier than the original, which required to keep pen and paper on hand occasionally. Whether you prefer this simpler kind of puzzle is a matter of taste, I personally enjoyed the note-taking, but the redesigned areas make up for that loss by being full of the particular flavor I loved in the original.The absolute best addition in my eyes though is the dedicated "talk" button to hear your companion's thoughts on any room you're in and the events that occur in them, not only does it work as a subtle hint system to keep you on track if you get lost, but it has a shocking amount of new lines for areas you wouldn't normally visit with a companion at all. The amount of love and care shown here makes the remake even more of an absolute steal.I would recommend this game in a heartbeat to anyone who enjoys horror, and especially to those who liked the era of RPG Maker Horror games, if they somehow managed to miss out on this one.

																To put it very simply: Ib is a game that means a lot to me. I've played the original over and over again, and this remake definitely improves on the original game that I already loved so much. It's largely the same, the OST remains untouched which I'm happy about because it's great and very nostalgic, there are a few new puzzles that were a new sort of challenge to me, I've played the original so much that I can basically clear it with my eyes closed, so the new puzzles were a great addition to make the game feel fresh. Plus, the puzzles that got replaced were the most annoying ones, so that's great! The art also has upgraded significantly, which is especially noticable in the CG's you get during the gameplay. All in all, great remake of an already great game!

It's somewhat short and the puzzles are relatively easy, but the game's multiple endings does offer a good deal of replayability.

The talk feature was relentlessly spammed by me for dialogueA lot of the base game was left untouched for the most part, plot and character remains the same, majority of the changes were aestheticA good update to a classic and highly recommended for anyone who loves a rpgmaker horror

																Beautifully done remake. The pixel art is truly marvelous, they spiced up a few puzzle segments and it makes a lot more sense now, but, overall, the gameplay is almost the same, there are no new endings or something like this. Different from 'The Witch's House MV', which offered a brand new game+ with different puzzles, Ib's remake is not that interesting if you already played the original after all the latest updates (the ehxibition patch), but it's still a good way to support the devs.

																Ib was a huge part of my childhood and played it so many times (I was around the same age as Ib when it came out in 2012). Now, it has once again came to bring that childhood joy I got out of it. It is a very short game and fairly easy, but I don't mind that at all. It is a fun experience and I feel the new puzzles that were implemented helps streamline the game more than the original. I'll be sure to play this one over and over again like I did back then. I adore it.

Another reason why I love this game, and would recommend, is because her name is my middle name. Never in my life would I ever find a character or whole entire game at that, be my name. My name is very unique and since Ib came out 10 years ago, my 12 year old self is dancing with joy. Love this!

																I have been waiting for a remake of this game for 10 YEARS!!!!!!!!! And it did not disappoint! Ib is an exploration game with horror-esque elements where you play Ib, a nine year old girl trying to escape an art gallery come to life. The game is very charming and fun! The story is simple but the writing is so good that it really gets you feeling for the characters! I love seeing everything revamped and revisiting my faves trying to escape the gallery. I love the multiple endings and how the difference between talking to a character or not at a certain point can help determine if they survive or not. Some endings can really make you feel things if for example you got an ending with a character you liked no longer with you and another character that escaped with you did something that made you go "WOAH, HEY!!" It's a great experience!

																A great horrific adventure game. I never played Ib before this remake but I'm glad I finally did it.There's nothing really scary about it but the art gallery in which you lose yourself is varied, full of creativity and is always giving off a creepy feeling.The characters you meet along the way are surprisingly fleshed out and endearing for a game so short (~4-5h)Gameplay-wise, there's a lot of walking around, some not-so-hard puzzles and just enough dialogues to make it interesting.I can only recommend it to people who like this kind of game!

Upon playing the remake it was not only nostalgic but fresh with great updated artwork and some new puzzles thrown into the mix! On my first playthrough I didn't get the ending I thought I was heading for, and upon seeing the other new features I might just head back into the gallery for another go.

I first got it and played it on my own in Japanese, and now that the English patch is out I wholeheartedly recommend everyone and anyone interested in Horror RPGs to give this game a chance. There are new puzzles compared to the original version and way more new dialogue this time around! Kouri is an amazing game creator and you feel like the love put into the game. If you want to play or look more into games of this genre, honestly look into Horror RPG Maker Games, there are some that have remakes on Steam and others that are for free out there.

																Nice remake. There's a lot of new conversations you can have with garry and mary compare to the original game. It's fun to see their reaction to different things, or even ask why you're going back so many rooms lolThanks for the translation

																Absolutely love that Ib has been added to Steam! I was a huge fan of the original and enjoyed playing it over and over. While that version was obviously good, Kouri has surpassed it and gone to excellent. I was expecting the same exact game (just better graphics maybe). But no, this game has new elements that make the gameplay so much better than the original. On top of that, it's definitely worth way more than the 13 USD price tag, just with the quality and care put into this game. I was astonished and blown away by the game I played, and am looking forward to many hours of play!

																Well, despite not being able to read the dialogue yet, very happy with this remake of Ib. They've streamlined certain areas, changed a few puzzles (for the better, unless you're gonna miss that hidden-button-maze room in the grey area), and overall it clearly pays homage to the original game's intent.Very excited for the incoming english version, but even just playing through with phone-translation and memory I'm a very satisfied fan! Thanks so much for taking the effort to make this, Kouri!
