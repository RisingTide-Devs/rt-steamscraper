    "original_text": "Overall the gaming experience was good and I've had a quite some fun. There's a bit awkward difficulty spike towards the end, mostly involving slightly to big hitboxes and lack of appropriate space to maneuver, but it's within an acceptable margin.\n\nThe story is simple, but interesting enough. \nIt probably stems from the fact that they've kept in mind that our protagonist is indeed just a little girl. \nShe's scared, but not in the manner an adult would be. She wonders about the spirits, at times getting spooked and surprised, but she doesn't really feel the horror. She lacks the adult viewpoint and just doesn't want to be alone and lonely. \n\nWhile I've had no issues myself it's certainly sad to see the amount of people which issues running the game. \nBut please don't get discouraged. The actual game itself is certainly worth of the \"Mostly Positive\" rating.\nConsider taking a look at this guide:\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1184305463\n\nAlso, fullscreen with a desktop resolution above 1920x1080 is horrid, please turn it off and use \"Scaling - Stretch\" which is the devs unique way of saying \"borderless window/fullscreen mode\".  I'm not sure what would happen on older 4:3 or Ultra-wide monitors though.\n\nA bit too many things have been left unexplained for my taste. Mind you, I'm not talking about the story. I'm fine with that. I'm talking about sub-events and mechanics. I would've liked a couple more of helpful remarks from the girl herself and more useful hints in the easier to find note/message type collectibles.\n\nThe most notable problem is that the statue quick save just functions as a re-spawn point and doesn't truly save progress unlike the save at home. \n\nThe other major thing that bothered me is the way the map only ever gets truly completed by performing a certain, late-game action, which makes thing awkward.  Before that there's various spots on the map that unavoidably will make you worry about whether or not you've missed something, even though you've been through in your exploration efforts.\n\nTalking about exploration. Most collectibles are reasonable easy to find as long as you thoroughly search the town and interact with the various spirits. However, after you've spent a couple of hours you might notice that there're are, probably three, items which really shouldn't make you feel too bad about taking a look at:\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=761744358\n\nThey're items based on sub-events with low chances. Getting them involves repeated actions aka farming. And it doesn't help that the game does NEVER straightforwardly tell you that you need to go home to properly reset things and get your next chance.\n\nAnd if you're an achievement hunter let's not forget to talk about the ridiculous 50 hour achievement. I gave up looking for the above mentioned items around the 12 hours mark. Walking around in free roam quickly gets tedious, because there's no real variation. I would bet someone with better gaming sense could find everything in this amount of time and more ambitious people would struggle for another 12 hours and get it done by then. But there's just no way to realistically spent 50 hours in this world. So get ready to use a save game or idle in-game. If you're planning to idle be sure to stay out of the menus and save occasionally, because it's your save game that needs to log 50 hours and not steam.\n\nNow one last little thing I would like to warn about, [b] a tiny spoiler [/b], is something that could possibly happen to you:\n\n[spoiler] If you're in the factory there'll be an auto quick save after you've crossed the large pipe. At this point make sure you get the relatively close by \"Rusty small key\". Getting this key can be somewhat tough challenge and you might have to try multiple times. If you go explore in the wrong direction, find the statue and quick save you'll have doomed yourself to a long walk, tedious walk for each try.  [/spoiler]",

The sound design works so well within the games system, as well as adding to the enviornment, it's nothing short of exemplary.\n- Well designed character, sprits and environments. Every single character as well as spirits are creatively designed and expertly illustrated, as well as expertly illustrated backgrounds and enviornments, expanding the simple 2d plane of the previous game to create a more dimensional gameplay. \n- Compelling gameplay; The heartbeat system returns from the previous game, as well as the function of revealing spirts via light sources. Each design of the spirts are wonderfull, and will inspire you to look more into their backstory and creation, as well as devising methods to deal with each specfic spirt you encounter.\n- Interesting Story. The story, while simple in its premise, is very well paced, and interlaced with elements of exploration and discovery, and leads to a satisfying conclusion.\n- Optional world building and item collecting. The option of exploring the game world has been expanded from the previous game: three entire pages of inventory have been dedicated to collectable items that have been scattered around town, each seemingly benign in appearence, but given an subtle eerie description. More optional events have been added, and exploring rewards the player with collectables and room decorations.\n- Expanded game area. The base area is roughly twice the size of the first game, providing unique districts and areas, as well as being able to return to the town from the first game in the post-game.\n\nCONS:\n-Some systems can be difficult to grasp for first time players. This game subtly decides that you have played the first game, and you dont have a long period to practice controlls\n- Some periods can be frustrating if you're having difficulty understand certain enemy or boss mechanics. \n-Certain locations are removed from the last save point, or do not give you the ability to return to the world map from the save points, so backtracking through an area might be a bit boring.\n\nIf you're interested in Horror and Japanese culture, this game is for you. I highlly recommend this game for anyone who likes well designed simple games, with a penchant for horror. 9/10",

It has a lot of gorgeous little scenes that show the team was more confident in designing environments, but the atmosphere is a bit dampened by it feeling a bit more gameplay heavy.\n\nIt still boils down to the same gameplay loop of starting a night, doing some specific objective, boss fight, rinse and repeat for a few hours. Your flashlight shows spirits, but some are visible no matter what. What changes a bit with this game is that it has a lot more spirits than the first game, and their lethality is turned up by eleven. Your average gamer will die a lot, and the game seems to compensate for this by giving you a lot more coins to save at the Jizo statues and tons of new items to deal with the various new spirits. Jizo Statues now also actually save instead of being general quicksave spots. Also a new form of \"puzzle\" is in the game, with you needing to carry or push objects in the environment. It's not really a puzzle though, you just kinda do the actions.\n\nPost game content is relatively the same, but instead of heavily relying on rare events, it now relies heavily on the aforementioned pushing and carrying mechanics. If it doesn't do this, it'll be some multi-chain process to get items. It can be quite obnoxious to get a lot of the collectables. If you're not interested in doing a 100% run, I recommend avoiding the entire post-game. \n\nIt wasn't as much of a problem with the previous game, but navigation can be super obnoxious specifically because of some new indoor areas. You cannot fast travel out of these indoor areas, and they are lethal labyrinths. \n\nDespite my dislike of some of the new changes, I enjoy this game a lot, so why do I not recommend it?\n\nBecause it also has a critical issue where the game just stops working. Nowhere near as bad as the previous game of course because it actually boots, but on both my computer and Steam Deck, it would just randomly close for no reason I could identify. While it did stop doing this eventually, it did it over seven times. Yes you can save a lot, but a game should not have an extra stress of making you need to save constantly so you can avoid losing progress. \n\nWhen the game was working on my Steam Deck 512 GB LCD, it ran smoothly just like the previous game with at least three hours thirty minutes of battery life and with no sound or graphical issues. I did not change my version of Proton. \n\nSame with the previous game, get it on sale if you're PC only and don't be afraid to refund it if it frustrates you or doesn't work. If you can, buy it on another platform as I do think it's worth it.",

    "original_text": "When this game was announced I was very excited since I played the first title and really enjoyed it. I personally don't like horror games and sometimes I'm way too scared to play one but the cute designs of the characters and the world building helped me get through this game.\n\n\nStory (Potential Spoilers)\nThe story this time is tells itself more compared to the first. Within the first game, you sort of piece things together and sort of figured out an interpretation but in Midnight Shadows there is more dialogue which helped you figure out what's going on which the first didn't do. I found that the items you picked up in Midnight Shadows did more warning of things than of telling a little bit of a story of the town. LIke in the first game you learned the fate of the ghost girl but the ghost girl in this game I felt didn't have much clues that lead to her demise unless I missed something. Though the main story is much more fleshed out.\n\nVisual/Audio\nThe game is again very pretty. Nicely detailed backgrounds that are dingy dark and foreboding at times. The character designs are simplistic and cute while the spirit designs are unsettling. Everytime I encountered a spirit I had chills running through my body. The game only has one song in it but much like the first game it is a great piece. Other than that, the game has ambient noise along with the haunting sounds of spirits at times. Again the sound design is very fitting and effective.\n\nGameplay\nMidnight Shadows plays very much like Night Alone. You can run, you can tip toe, you can control where you point the flashlight, you can hide, and use items. The game adds equipable charms which will give you some sort of a benefit. Another mechanic that was added is the ability to push objects and carry objects both of which disables you ability to use your flash light. So you basically wander around town dodging spirits. One thing I feel like the game lacked was more utilization of the pushing and holding of objects. They could have used that mechanic more. The game was more straight forward. I remember in Night Alone that there are some items you basically had to find in order to get through situations which the game didn't guide you to find. The end game had a very interesting gimmick though. So very much like the first game. It felt good to play and it was pretty easy but that may be because I played the first and in some cases knew what to expect.\n\nSummary\nIt was a fun experience the story was interesting enough for me to push forward. The gameplay was not too hard but not too easy though I feel like it was easier for me compared to the first. It still has things like the game saving you progress even when you don't save at a save point meaning you retain treasures you picked up when you die. The game is still very pretty and the audio fits to make spine chilling encounters. There are some jump scares too.\n\nI'd recommend the game but I will say that it is a little pricey. Though I think those looking to 100% the game will get some more bang for the buck but unless you are a big fan of the first game I would say wait out for a sale.",

The game is more accessible, without losing anything from the previous one. For example you can save at any checkpoint, not just at the end of each act. There are more locations to explore, a creepy plot and setting and a wide range of disturbing enemy. The game is quiet long compared with the original (~8 hours; 15 to do everything), with a lot secondary things to do. The game is not easy, with lot of difficult situations, but it is more polite in its design.\n\nThe problem is if you played the first Yomawari, because in that case you will have lot of deja-vú. Many enemies and also situations are completely recycled from the previous game. However this is just a part, because the majority of the game is original and innovative. Especially the final boss deserve an applause, both in term of design and gameplay.\n\nThe game is a beautiful and dark fairytale, with an amazing atmosphere and a nice sense of exploration. The price is a bit exaggerated, maybe wait a bit and buy when is in discount, you will not regret it. \n(Version played: Beta)",

At the end of the tutorial your character hangs herself setting the mood for the rest of the game. Right after that and you're back to playing her seemingly fine and going out to watch the fireworks with her friend, What happened with that opening? is it the future? Can I stop this? Already the game does a way better job of getting its hooks into you, the story while it lags a bit in the middle is far superior to Night Alone (where it was mostly just a framing device) and this serves to carry the game home when the horror fades.\n\nAnd yes the horror won't last the whole game, there are some scares to be had don't get me wrong, but like any horror game time will inoculate you to fear, monsters still for the most point boil down to thing to run from and there are still some encounters that rely on cheap deaths (looking at you mansion level) which would help speed up the fear immunisation if it was earlier in the game. On the other hand much improved is one element from the first game I enjoyed, that being the little side stories you could encounter. While in Night Alone these were random with such low chances of happening that you'd probably never see them in a normal playthrough, in Midnight Shadows these are simply hidden away for you to find with clues mentioning folklore and rumours that you can use to uncover these events without being at the mercy of RNG (there is still a terrible RNG event in the game though).\n\nOverall if you like Night Alone you'll adore Midnight Shadows, and if you didn't touch it or disliked it, then maybe this game might bring you around.",

The driving reason behind that is the terrible boss fights in this game. The normal gameplay isn't that interesting, but the boss fights will make you sorely miss it. It's not that they're challenging. If you know what to do they will usually only take a couple of tries. What makes them so bad is that there's really no fun to them at all past the first attempt (because it doesn't really even feel like gameplay, more like an extended cutscene) and you're intentionally punished by the developers for dying in the battles by having your time wasted. I'm not kidding, they intentionally waste your time between attempts in order to make beating it without dying feel more important. That wouldn't be such a big deal if some of the boss battles weren't so finicky/luck based.\nBut anyway, the strong points of this game being the story and art means that you can just watch a Let's Play of the game and get all the same real value out of it.

It is almost nostalgic in nature, similar to that of Cry of Fear. It´s almost relaxing to walk around in them, despite the imminent danger.\r\n\r\nThe stories are mostly comprised of quiet, minimalist dialogue that heavily relies on visual and metaphysical aid and leaves some room for interpretation. Yet they never feel preachy of pretensious. They have a purpose.\r\n\r\nThe monsters of the series are fascinating. Most often, they are mixture of uncanny, compared to the rest of the adorable artstyle, kind of endearing and a well-developed vision of classic Japanese myths and legends. As such, the players, specifically those acquainted with these myths, are intrigued and horrified by the beings all the same.\r\n\r\nI don`t know if this essay throughly explains my fascination for the games, but I hope that you enjoyed regarding it, dear reader.

I think those are what made the first game good, but this game did away with both of them. You are constantly being guided and escorted through the world, and it's hard to go 5 minutes without some cheap jumpscare being thrown at you. Adding more guidance is forgivable since I do believe that is a big flaw with the original, and you are still free to explore once you're done, but I just don't think this game handles guidance well. I'd rather have the sense of loneliness add to the fear factor over constantly being told where to go when i've already figured it out, and many parts are still just as confusing and unclear as in the original. It's really struggling to find a good middle ground here. And as for the jumpscares, well i think a png creepypasta style face popping up on screen speaks for itself. Feels more like mid 2000s youtube than a horror game i paid for.\nI also managed to clip out of bounds a few times breaking everything; I thought the boss fights were even more confusing and even more reliant on trial and error than before; I thought some parts were very lazy copy pastes from the first game; and I think some things are without a doubt not being discovered unless you're following a guide.\n\nAll that being said, I still loved this. I thought the world was interesting, the characters were interesting and loveable, the puzzles were enjoyable, the aesthetics are charming, the story was easy to get invested in, the post game was fantastic, and despite my complaints i had a really good time overall. I think it's full of problems, but i still found myself having fun. I think if i wasn't comparing it to the first game, i would have very few complaints.

As such, it's advisable to be very careful when looking at guides and stuff.  I would criticize the gameplay in that sometimes when you have to walk a long distance, especially over and over, it gets tedious because even running, your character is slow.  I would praise the use of strategy with different ghost behaviors to avoid death, and the fact that you're killed in one hit can make the game very tense and make you feel like you're actually a defenseless kid, but at the same time it does cause frustration sometimes.  Fortunately, the game is pretty good about giving you save points right before places you'll likely die.  The best thing about this game would definitely be the atmosphere.  The art is beautiful, and gives a very nostalgic, countryside/old-fashioned Japanese neighborhood feel.  Despite all the ghosts I found myself wanting to visit this place.  Overall, it's only medium difficulty and pretty accessible/intuitive with controls, and though it may not be really horrifying, the jumpscares are unsettling without being cheap.  It's commendable how little the game tries to interfere with your experience, like it isn't trying to shove in your face that you're about to be scared, it just lets you get scared on your own and scares you with environmental storytelling and excellent sound work.  Altogether it's more of a playable horror movie than a game, but I'd still recommend it for a decent, short horror experience, which should be especially effective for those who grew up in fear of Asian ghost mythos like myself.",

You can only truly save by entering your house, which you cannot do whenever you want. Playing this game with limited time doesn't really enable me to pick this game up and put it back down again.\n\nThe controls are a bit clunky, but not intolerable, however combined with this strange question mark/exclamation point notification system, I find myself wondering what I am trying to interact with half of the time.\n\nThere are too many enemies, scattered all throughout the level. A heartbeat sound warns you when they are close, but it is going off pretty much through the entirety of your trip. This makes it both kind of annoying, but also really frustrating when you are trying to ignore it and a monster runs out to kill you. \n\nAlso the foreground, very often gets in the way of the view spectrum. This can be quite tedious to deal with, I don't mind the loss of control too much, but it makes dealing with exploration a pain because of its frequence. Pair this with a lack of direction from the game, and you have a mediocre experience. \n\nI can neither say you should play this game, or should not.

Start playing this at 0200am and I have class at 0800am. GG.[/i]\n\nPossible spoilers. Though I don't think I spoil anything, but you know, just in case...\n\nI wanted to play this game so bad ever since it came out on Vita last year in Japan but there's no way I'm cashing out a few bucks for PSVita just to play this game. To my suprise it gets a Steam release. I got so excited that I pre-ordered it.\n\nDoes it meet my expectation? For now it exceeds way more than my expectation.\n\n[h1]Don't judge a book by it's cover[/h1]\nDespite the cute art, the gameplay can be hard and brutal. Heck,[spoiler]this game f@$k you up when you just in the tutorial.[/spoiler] In general, you play as a little girl who tries to find her older sister. You have to dodge,hide or find a way to get past the ghosts lurking in your neighbourhood while finding her. What I really love about this game is that most of the time it force you to figure things out  on your own. You'll collect tools along the way and it's up to you to figure out what it does.\n\n[h1]Details at it's best [/h1]\nThe background art is filled with all those little details you might miss in your first glance. It looks like it was painstakingly hand-drawn each. But what really sold me is the sound. Each different surface you step on has different sound. You also have to pay attention to sound when you play this game. Your heart beats louder indicates a ghost is getting closer. In this game you can set what language you want to play in. English or Japanese. Choosing one of them will change the language not only to dialogue, but the street signs, notice board, and almost all the in-game enviroment all changed into the language you choose.\n\n[h1]Controls [/h1]\nPlaying with gamepad is highly recommended. I mean no suprise,right? Since it's a console port. You can play with keyboard and mouse but it might be hard to get used to for some players. Credits to the devs still as they had make playing with keyboard and mouse not as awkward as some other port I know. For me it works just fine.\n\n[h1]Technical [/h1]\nThough it wasn't a problem for me and I don't know if anyone find this as nuisance but just for a heads up, my RX480 can't reach a solid 60fps. Which for me is weird for a game like this. It ranges from 56-50fps. Do tell me how the game performs on your rig.",

This game is more of a trap than anything, there are no updates for issues fixes and seems to have been abandoned. I myself have tried to change settings, windows, etc, and have done everything recommended and possible. The beta might work for some, but hasn't for me. According to several others, even when the game works there are still many issues that prevent the player from actually playing. \n\nI love playing games of this variety, but I just can't with this one with all the issues presented. If the problem ever gets solved I will fix my review. Till then I can't recommend this game to anyone who is interested and highly discourage it, even when on sale. Until then I must hope there are enough reviews about the problem that something is finally done. Even if you doubt you will have this issue, I don't recommend finding out. Especially since I cannot get a refund after wasting my life trying to solve it's issues. This game isn't worth the effort, even if it just costed a quarter.\n\nUPDATE: I somehow managed to get to the loading screen and barely past it. Using windows 95 on administrator, while using steam beta. It helps if you remove the steam overlay as well. I have been constantly messed with the game since purchase, to forcefully make it to work. But, I cannot get it open from steam itself, plus you have to mess with the settings in a very specific way to even have it open past the loading screen on folder. Even if your using the same settings as what might be recommended, is not enough to make it open.\n\nThe game still instantly crashes 90 percent of the time before getting to the loading screen. I somehow managed to play around a few seconds before crashing once again. IF I can make it function and play a decent amount I will edit things once again.",

I like this game and I want to like it even more, but I simply cannot. \n\nOne of the most enjoyable things was definetly artstyle! The details on little trees, sidewalks and diffrent ideas for each spirit caught my eye. Background objects and houses with spirits that interacted with them was such an amazing thing to experience first hand. The shopping district and the forest were my favourites, when it came to visuals! As an explorer myself - finding items in the most obscure, hidden places was also a lot of fun. I like how we're rewarded whenever we collect an item and it shows our collection process, magnificent! Flavour texts from notes is thoughtful addition too! Heartbeat mechanic was also intetresting on paper and it really enchanced the horror experience the first few times you encounter the spirits!\nThe cutscenes were also very well made, but it I wish they wouldn't play out every time we died.\n\nUnfortunately this is where the positives end. The clipping textures and chopped pieces of the objects on the map while exploring. A minor thing, but definetly an ick for some. Additionally the chase sequences specially further in the game can be pretty challenging for the average person. The enemies have a big upper hand on you. Teleport near protagonist, dash when you're out of breath - sometimes it was so frustrating I wanted to quit the game and leave it here! So many sequences that just build up more and more negative feelings rather than encourge the player to learn something from their death. But what it is to learn, if you're just powerless! As I mentioned earlier the heartbeat mechanic was fun, but in my opinion - executed poorly. It feels like you need to be lucky to pass some sections without the major punishment of reseting from the same statule multiple times.\n\nOverall this game is best to buy on sales and play, if you'd like a bit of thrill. I don't think it's worth a full price considering the negatives listed above, but it's still worth buying!",

    "original_text": "Wander around a giant empty map filled with recycled assets and absurdly diverse enemies with unexplained behaviour patterns, doing relatively generic horror game chores until you run out of things to do; and are expected to just keep wandering until you find the arbitrary thing meant to progress.\n\n\nThe main map that players spend most of their time in is a large, empty series of streets made of perpetually recycled assets. There's nothing interesting to look at, it's all just typical small town architecture with a lot of empty space and pointless diverging paths. The game is just you wandering around said sandbox doing chores.\n\nThe game features a ridiculous amount of different enemies. They are sprinkled around the map with absolutely zero logic or consistency, and each of them behaves in completely different ways yet players are expected to figure it out themselves for each individual enemy. Do they have an actual line of sight, are they faster then the player, are they distracted by throwable objects, are they invisible when the player is not looking directly at them, does hiding even make any difference at all, does slow walking even make any difference at all. Figure it out yourself for every single of the dozen plus creatures, die over and over, most of the unique mechanics are pointless as most of the enemies do not seem to be effected by them. Why do the unique mechanics even exist then if most of the enemies are not coded to react of them. Instead you might as well just run away from them as that's the only consistent way to avoid them, the most boring and typical way.\n\nSome enemies are invisible unless you are looking at them and directly shining your light on them, so sometimes you will just die because something invisible jumped you. Other times you will die because the enemy is obscured by something in the foreground and you cannot see it. There is a feature where your heart beats when something is close, but there are so many enemies spastically placed all over the map that your heart is beating half the time. So it's mostly just an auditory annoyance.\n\n\nThe basis of the gameplay itself is just generic horror game chores, go here and pick up this to unlock this to get this to do this. Which would not be so bad if the game wasn't set in a massive bland empty map where the only interesting thing to do is these chores. There's no nuance to the map design, it's just empty streets. Just like there is no nuance to the enemy design, they are just placed all over the map in random spots and have random behaviours which are mainly just countered by running away.\n\nThen there is the dog enemy which sometimes jumps out of the bushes in one of two places, and instantly kills you unless you immediately run into a nearby bush with less then half a second of time to spare. So it just kills you over and over until you learn the meta of getting as close to its trigger as possible, triggering it, then immediately dashing into the nearby bush.\n\nAnother unique mechanic is where the game hints to you whenever an interactable object is nearby. Most of the time it triggers on hiding spots, which are obvious and so telling the player about them is pointless. Other times it triggers on important things. But the range at which it activates is so broad, you can never tell what exactly it's hinting to so you just have to run around looking for what triggered it. Could be an obvious hiding spot, could be something you need to progress the game. All it really does is totally confuse the player as the trigger radius is so massive it might as well not exist at all.\n\nThe game is not scary, at all. There is zero atmosphere, or ambience. And there is no suspense since the player is constantly surrounded by generic enemies with the annoying heart beat sound going off. While the enemies are not intimidating either since the map is so oversaturated with them. There are hardly even any unique events in the game, most of the time you just wander around running away from enemies that just follow you.\n\n\nIt has nice art, and that is about it. The story is generic and typical, the map is empty and boring, the enemies are asinine and tedious; while all the unique mechanics are either unused or just make the game more annoying. It's not even remotely scary as a horror game, and it's not even remotely fun as an adventure game.",

    "original_text": "It's a cute horror game, that is based on all kind of japanese myths and urban legends. It begins great with the main story being engaging since the very beginning and doesn't disappoint you throughout the whole game, and if you want some more of it there are lots of tiny details, clues and hints surrounding the town if you want to learn more about it. \n\nIt's not a scary game by any means, but has it's own unique/creative moments, considering it features a huge variety of ghosts/creatures, so you often don't know what to expect, which made a big impression on me. Usually in other games, you see same type of monsters all over again, and you get used to their behavior and appearance, but in Yomawari you have spirits that you see only once, or they have a rare spawn chance and encountering them adds a lot to the atmosphere. Each one of them has it's own symbolism and story behind their hauntings. That's where the exploration shines in this game, it's fun and rewarding. Art style is very pleasing to the eye, sometimes it's very detailed, and sometimes a bit lazy, mushy.. I'm not sure what was the budget and the scope of the project, but the main character and all the things that she does is done purposely in a very cute way, while the horror aspect of the game I think it borrows some inspiration from Yume Nikki and popular creepypastas. \n\nNow the bad things, first of.. the save system is confusing and cryptic. There is an actual guide online that explains to people how to actually save your game, it's something that game doesn't explain properly and you may lose a lot of your progress if you don't get the idea behind how it works. It's vague and badly designed. Quite often you will end up in situations where massive objects will block your view, such as houses or trees and you have no idea where you are going, to make it worse, devs put enemies or hidden objects in such areas, as if they tried to annoy the players by exploring their own badly designed choices. Why not make these things transparent once they block your view? Nope, let's just make it more irritating. The game encourages you to hide into bushes from enemies that you can't outrun, but even if you use them and wait for more than a good minute, they won't go away, they will just wait till you come out and insta kill you, which makes it useless. Also some achievements are nonsensical or require you to trigger random rare events, which will require you to restart and revisit same places dozens of times. When you spot a spirit, or the game tells you that a threat is nearby, you'll hear heart beats, the first time I heard them they quickly felt so annoying.. I thought I will get a headache soon if I continue playing, but eventually I got used to it. But I feel like there could've been an alternative way on executing this mechanic differently..\n\nIt's an interesting and a good game overall, but suffers from a bad game design, and some technical problems, considering it's a rough PS Vita port. I feel like it's not really worth it's full price on the handheld, but it's a nice treat during the steam sale.",

Pretty graphics, intriguing start of the story and a grim world which you'd like to discover. At the first glance...\n\nThen gameplay happened. And it's awful. We have to go somewhere, and the same moment try to avoid enemies whom we can see only in the flashlight. Some spirits fast and specially for that we have a sprint bar. Which continues in danger situations for a second only. Just one second, Carl. I retried some moments dozens of time. Gameplay here extremely annoying and repulsive. \n\nI continued to play because of the atmosphere and my curiosity about the story. Here I wasn't rewarded too. They didn't explain anything even after the final. What did happen with the town? Why it happened? A lot of questions without answers.\n\nAnyway, after the end of the story developers let us free walk through the town. And now appeared some collectibles for achievement, which weren't here while I had played before credits. Cute, right? So, I am a trophy hunter and I like achievements. It's 40% of formula \"why I buy games\". But here they are disgusting. I'd call them like a time-wasting trophies. Seriously, they were made specially for taking your time as much as it could be. For example, while I am writing this lines, I am earning a trophy called \"Long night\". I have to play the game 50hrs. So Yomavari just working in the background. Yeah, I finished this game in ten hours with other achievements and a guide how to reach 'em. If you think that was the worst kind of trophies, you're wrong. The game has some with a small random chance of getting it. Even if you fulfill all the conditions it does not mean you can take it. Proximately 5-10-% of success. And if not, so go home and try again. To take a \"monster cat\" took me about 30 attempts (1,5 hour). Checked my PC resources for a case of mining after all.\n\nBig expectations about this game were pointless. Silent Hill, they said. Deep grim atmosphere and story, they said. *Sigh\n\nP.s.

Don't let the cutsey imagery fool you, this game's story hits you really hard right at the beginning. It's a very good combination of cute, and creepy that gives me at least that same kind of creeping fear that I used to get when climbing a dark staircase at night as a child. \n\nThe artwork is also worth mentioning. It's like if Hayao Miyazaki had a nightmare in the middle of writing Spirited Away and decided to make a game in his spare time based off of it. Very cutsey. Very Japanese. And the monsters look very youkai inspired. But some of them you can tell could have just been everyday objects if you weren't a child lost in a town in the middle of the night. It's cool, intriguing, spooky, and cutsey all at the same time.\n\nGive this game a shot if you haven't yet.

Nights in Japan get pretty crazy however, and you must avoid being killed by spirits that apparently dont like your presence very much. The game itself might not satisfy you if you're looking for some intense horror, but there are at least a few good spooks in here. Its also important to consider the context, as you are an innocent child who is probably around 8 years old facing the very real consequence of death.\n\nThe Good:\n+The game does an excellent job at mixing cute and scary with its artstyle. The atmosphere is also pretty on point.\n+Overall design for the characters and spirits is really good and unique.\n+Gameplay is simple yet effective, consisting of running from and avoiding spirits using various methods.\n+There is a surprising amount of depth to the story, and quite a few heartwarming moments.\n+Many small and subtle occurences throughout the town add some intrigue and mystery to the game.\n+The game runs like a charm and I havent encountered any bugs whatsoever.\n\nThe Bad:\n-Certain areas of the game can be a bit heavy on unfair deaths until you figure out how to make it through.\n-At $20 the game isnt more than about 5 hours long, so the price may seem a bit much for some people.\n-The game isnt exactly the scariest despite its good atmosphere. Spooky at best.\n-An innocent little girl getting killed over and over is not okay. Dont mess up too much.\n\nIts also worth noting that the game can actually be bit difficult at times, but this isnt much of a problem though since its mostly just simple trial and error. Overall a very good game that I highly recommend if you willing to pay the $20 despite how short it is (or at the very least grab it when its on sale).",

    "original_text": "If you're interested in Yomawari: Night Alone, it's likely you are looking for a horror game or something distinctly Japanese. With this one videogame you get both elements, and they're delivered in a way that I can guarantee is something you need to experience for yourself to appreciate. You will not be disappointed.  \n\nYomawari: Night Alone succeeds in its genre where other horror games fail by imposing a sense of subtle stress on the player. I'm not saying this game will make your hair turn grey, but it might just tense you up. Its endearing design draws you into a bubble, then pops it without warning. Then it does it again, and again, every time a new chapter begins or a new enemy is introduced. Playing Yomawari is like drowning in a bubble bath while your rubber ducky watches on... and I mean that in the best way possible. \n\nA passing glance at Yomawari doesn't do the game justice; Nippon Ichi Software's trademark cuteness is paired with a number of unsettling sensory experiences that deserve the full attention of every horror game fan. It's important to describe the game's elements in this manner because Yomawari isn't only pleasing for it's visual aesthetics. The sound design is among the clearest, cleanest, most detailed experiences in any past or present horror game. There is a surprising level of depth to everything from your own footsteps over metal grates to the wind rustling through nearby trees. Enemies skitter about and groan in ways expected of their horror genre counterparts, but every little note and noise is executed strategically. Yomawari sounds like how a nightmare should sound. Everything is satisfyingly disquieting. \n\nPerhaps most important to those reading Steam reviews, the game's mechanics are minimal but appropriate considering the world you're dropped into. The main character's defenses from the dangers of Yomawari's ghost filled streets are limited to a somewhat restrictive endurance system. You truly feel like you have the fortitude of a small, scared child. In-game adrenaline is lacking, despite the constant lub-dub of your heartbeat telling you monsters are near. A single bar and a beeping light at the bottom of the screen indicate just how much more energy you have left to escape your threats. A handful of usable items (five in total) help keep the dangers of the world at bay, but in no way eliminate the threats around you. And those threats truly are dangerous. Yomawari contains jumpscares. It contains enemies that can and will kill you many times until you discover the pattern of avoiding them. This is ultimately the games worst weakness, even if the system of try-and-try-again is very forgiving. There is little to no consequence for \"dying\" in Yomawari; you keep every item you collect, even if it was picked up immediately before being killed. And that's for a very good reason, since the amount of collectibles in this game - which range from curiously childlike to downright macabre - is quite large. Finding them all is an achievement in and of itself, as they are mostly optional to the story. Yet, the collectibles add a depth and feel, making them not feel tacked on or pointless. I genuinely wanted to find each ball of hair and broken dog toy and little crayon note that's scattered through the town. As long as you remember that searching is going to be dangerous, it becomes quite a fun little hunt. The game does remain dangerous and surprising throughout, even if your abilities to search the town are never truly upgraded or expanded. You're not playing Silent Hill where a shotgun is dropped on your lap and it's suddenly revealed you have godlike firing accuracy. You're a little girl whipping rocks, matches and dog treats in an often futile attempt to distract the immortal creatures of the night. And if your tiny arsenal of options run out, then with a heart-splattering darkness you say goodnight to your night alone.\n\nThe upside is that with every death, you are instantly teleported to the latest save point, which appear in the form of Jizo statues throughout the town. Interestingly enough, this particular choice in statue is indicative of an incredibly rich understanding of Japanese folklore that is pervasive through all of Yomawari. The Jizo statue is a representation of Kshitigarbha, a Buddhist deity known for it's connection to deceased children and hell-beings. The game's themes of childhood, fear of the unknown, longing for the decased - they're all powerful ideas that are strengthened by the unique world in which the game is set. When you die, you return home, or to Jizo (depending on where you last saved in relation to the chapter's start). You are a child, returning to the patron of dead children. This kind of subtlety helps the game go beyond using a typical Japanese suburb as the backdrop to just another horror game. It gives Yomawari an impressive depth and respect for not only its subject matter, but the connection to life's horrors as seen through a uniquely Japanese lens. This game isn't just about cute anime girls and jumpscares: Yomawari's developers went to great lengths to weave in a culturally rich narrative to their already interesting gameplay. \n\nAs for the story itself? Spoiler's aside, a few searches online into some of the religious and cultural references help make Yomawari story a bit less opaque, as at times it can seem just that. Without brushing up on your Japanese folklore, the story can come off as simplistic. You are a little girl tasked in finding her missing family in a town that's been steeped in the very worst bits and bobs of childhood fears. Regardless, Yomawari's story relies heavily on the experience of playing the game - which, as a reviewer and a fan of good horror, I say it accomplishes wonderfully. Even without an indepth understanding of Japanese folklore, the story is bolstered by an overall game design that helps define the narrative just enough. It isn't a visual novel, it isn't a definitive action title. Yomawari: Night Alone is it's own entity, a truly unique video game that I recommend to anyone interested in Japanese folklore or horror in general.",

The atmosphere is perfect for giving the player an unnerved feeling. If you want to try a horror game but you’re a bit of a chicken [like myself] this game shouldn’t be nightmare-inducing or keep you up at night, but it might give you a fright here and there.\n\nThe game controls took a little bit to get used to: I found myself more than once accidentally using the wrong item in an inappropriate moment because I forgot to switch this or that. There is no real combat, the game is more about avoidance.\nFor those of you going for completion, look everywhere for items, you will need to collect a lot. A guide may prove useful. Many of the collections item achievements rely on one another to be finished. \n\nI am basically done with this game except for one hang up. The achievement that requires 50+hrs of gameplay is glitchy and may require a replay of the game or some specific trick to make it work. [Personally, I don’t have the patience or time for that. Forever 99%.]\n\nThis game was a fun but eerie experience. Would recommend to those who aren’t looking for a hard-core horror experience.\n\nAchievement Hunter’s Note: Hoard salt. The Long Night achievement tends to glitch. This may keep you from 100%-ing the game as it did for me.\nAchievement Acquisition Difficulty: Medium  \n",

I was a little scared after seeing all the reports after my purchase but there were no issues.\nThe only thing that happened a few times was that when I played on Steam Deck and it went on Standby Mode the game would freeze and I had to restart it.\n\nBesides that I had a lot of fun exploring the game and collecting all the items. The riddles (with the Mary Doll or the Hide & Seek) were my favorites. There is a slight jumpscare, the death screen. Not really a jumpscare but it can catch you offguard sometimes and definitely jumpscare you.\nI liked the ending & I think It's really cool that you can continue playing and exploring after finishing the story.\n\nThe achievements were fun but the 'Long Night' Achievement (Play for 50 hours) is a bad idea for the game and badly designed as well. You usually finish the game in about 10-12 hours, so even 2 playthroughs would just cover half of the achievement... worst part is that you have to achieve 50 SAVED ingame hours. Means if you have 50 hours on steam client but lost 8 hours of progress because you did not save ingame, it doesn't count and you don't get the achievement.\nVery important note as well: You can ONLY save at home. The little shrines are just checkpoints for your respawn after you die somewhere. If you DO NOT save at home you will lose your progress and the hours shown on steam are inofficial.\n\nI'd recommend it. If you enjoy horror games that have their main focus on the story. you will like this one! ( •ω•ฅ)",

The main driving force of this game is exploration like in other games like Yume Nikki, but without the surrealism of Yume Nikki.

    "original_text": "A fun casual horror game with a very morbid beginning.\nWorth it if you get it on sale (Got mine for like $2.50 after watching some streamers play the beginning).\nKind of niche so I would look into the first 10 min of gameplay to see if you like the play-style.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:\nThe controls on the PC port are clunky and some people have crashing issues.\nI would not recommend playing this game without a controller.\n\nThe out of the box \"Controller support\" does not work with any of the xbox one, xbox 360, or gamepads I have. I was able to fix this however by going to steam settings > Controller > General Controller Settings then check the boxes on EVERYTHING to have controller support enabled for any device you can think of. Doing this made the game start working with my xbox 360 controller.\n\n====================================================================\nUpdate after completion of the game:\n\nThis game has some puzzles that can be convoluted at times, however with persistence and or a game guide this no longer becomes an issue. The story is overall engaging and a fun mostly casual horror experience. It mixes elements of cute character designs and fun item descriptions with some dark subject matter and an enjoyable horror game.\n\nThe one thing that nearly killed the experience for me without spoiling any of the plot is that near the very end of the game you are forced to try and run past large hand enemies down a narrow path. There are community posts about how BS it is that the enemies not only have incorrect hit boxes, but you also have to greatly rely on luck or getting the ai stuck to continue on. After about probably 30min-1hr I was able to finally figure out how to bug out the first AI to get stuck on small poles to continue onward. The second AI commonly gets stuck on a pole unless you hug the lower part of the map which sounds like a good thing until you realize it often forces a player death by blocking the path.\n\nEven though I was eventually able to get past them by beating my head against a wall, this level of flawed game design is one of the worst instances I have ever seen. Even having played countless hours of dark souls and many unforgiving games this task was an extreme and unenjoyable task to complete which I doubt many casual players would be willing to stick it out long as I was to complete the story. This is a shame considering that not only is the story enjoyable, but this happens right before the final boss of the game which is much easier and there are probably many out there who could not finish the story right at the end due to negligence on the creator.\n\nIf this was the only flaw with the game it could still be fine, but with the poor optimization of the PC port where many other users reported crashing, the clunky pc controls/not working controller support out of the box, and some extremely convoluted puzzles at times this game is hard to recommend without any fixes from the creators (which I doubt will happen since this game was released about 8 years ago).\n\nEven with all of the flaws I still recommend this game for its unique story and memorable intro for anyone who is willing to look past its flaws and is persistent enough to complete the main story. Even if you get stuck on the last level like I did, Id recommend looking up the ending of the game for a satisfying conclusion to the game.",

    "original_text": "Let me begin by saying that although I like this game, I do not think it's worth 20$.\n\nThe game offers around 4-7 hours of gameplay depending on whether you die often or have trouble finding key items, and maybe a little more if you wish to find all the collectibles.\n\nThe mechanics are simple and create a creepy and helpless atmosphere, but some are underutilized, like the stone throwing. (Some monsters reacts to your presence or the noise you make, but don't react when you throw stones).\n\nDeath in this game is a bit too permissive; you keep all your items after daying, which means that running, pressing A to loot, and dying works just fine to progress the game, which is a shame in my opinion.\n\nThe game brings you to the four corner of your town, each time discovering some dark secrets and resolving cases. Each time, a new zone will open and you will find clues leading you to your sister and your dog. The story is not the driving force behind your actions, but it would have been nice to have a little more, as I couldn't get invested. R.I.P. Poro though.\n\nEach zones reuses the same mechanics, each time with some twists, sometimes the spirits are different and requires new strategies, or the zone itself is labyrinthine.\n\nAs the game progresses, I feel like it loses its charm. The mechanics are quite barren, and beside the scary aspects of the spirits and the atmosphere, the game doesn't have much to offer.\n\nThe three last zones in particular, Downtown, The Factory, and beyond the tunnel, each brings a bad aspect of the game to light.\n\nDowntown makes you play with a special mechanic that I won't spoil, but to resume, it lets you play with 'perspective'. In the first, monsters blocks your path, and in the other they don't, but you can't accomplish your objective. You need to navigate the two perspectives and place special items in certain locations.\n\nI had to rack my brain and roam through the whole zone to finally succeed after dying a couple of times, and even then, I completed my objective by running like a madman and ignoring the spirits. This wouldn't be a problem had the game not based its entire atmosphere around running AWAY from spirits.\n\nAnyway, I can't call the zone bad, but I won't call it good either.\n\nHowever, a zone I will call frustating is; The Factory.\n\nThe game's end is near, and you feel it; spirits wandering everywhere, a big monster chasing you at certain times, and a big but not open zone.\n\nThis area was very frustrating. At specific moments, a big monster will chase you, and if you do not begin to run the moment the cutscene ends, you die. It took a couple of tries, but the thing, you don't respawn right next to those cutscenes, you generally have to run twenty to thirty seconds before.\n\nBut The Factory is nothing compared to the end.\n\nThe last zone, not named in the game, but that I will call Beyond The Tunnel here, is sometimes fine, and selectively horrendous.\n\nYou have to avoid 'hands', but those spirits get stuck on terrains, meaning that you can have trouble predicting them, plus you have to manage your stamina like never before, and moves precisely, AND do this three times in a row if your game bugs like me.\n\nAfter each hand, you will reach a safe zone, and the game is supposed to save. Well, it wasn't the case for me, so I had to perfect the three hands that get stuck of f*cking terrain in a row, knowing that if I failed, I would have to do it all over again. In few words, excruciating moments, and bad game design.\n\nAnd finally, you arrive at the end! The final boss is before you! I won't spoil anything, but I will tell just one thing.\n\nThe boss is laughably easy compared to the hands that get stuck on terrain.\n\nYou finished the game, congratulations, now you can go collect and the sh*t people threw around the town, spend 50 hours with your game in the background to have an achievement, or kick a can 50 times for another one.\n\nAnd that's all for my review. Despite its flaws, I liked the game. But to be honest, it's really not worth 20$. It offers no replayability, it's 6 hours long if you don't search around, and it's lenght is inflated by all the collectibles laying around. (Looking at you \"Kid's sandal\"). The story is barebone and the mechanics won't keep you around either. But it's not a bad time, and I had a fun time with my friend, so my 5$ were well spent.\n\nIf you wish to buy the game, wait for sales, I can't decently recommend it for 20$.",

You control a young girl looking for her missing sister, who went out to find your pup and never returned. The town isn’t exactly as peaceful as you might expect, either.\n\nGameplay focuses on evading monsters and scouring the environment for objects and ways forward. Pretty much every monster can instakill you, which leads to some annoying sections of trial and error. You can hide in some things like bushes, but that might not always be enough. There are also a ton of collectibles, encouraging you to explore the town and surrounding environments. Monsters also change based on which part of the game you’re in, letting you explore areas you may have missed earlier.\n\nThe monsters themselves have some cool, scary designs. The gameplay sometimes makes them more frustrating than scary to deal with though. The trial-and-error sections are hurt by the occasionally terrible checkpoints. There are also points in the game which really tug at your heart. The moment you see that you have a dog, you know it’s going to be involved in sad events, for example. The atmosphere is bolstered by creepy sightings and a great soundscape. Be warned that there are jumpscares in addition to the well-done atmosphere. \n\nI didn’t encounter any noteworthy glitches or crashes, but I’ve seen other people report them while playing. Overall, this is a great game with some annoying sections. If you had to play one of the two games in this series, I would recommend Midnight Shadows instead, which features a lot of improvements.",

    "original_text": "This isahesitant recommendation, and I'll explain why.\n\nI have heard small buzzes about this game for a while now, so I finally bought it on sale (which I'd highly recommend doing, as it's avery short game, about 4-5 hours tops). It's got a great Silent Hill type set up. You're a young girl walking her dog one night when said dog is run over. You go home and tell your sister that the dogis missing, and she goes out to find it. But when she doesn't come back, you set out to find her, exploring the town and dodging the spirits that roam the streets at night.\n\nFor positives, it'smostly the production values. The art is simply gorgeous and the sparse sound evokes a quietly disturbing atmosphere of dread and mystery. The monster design is top notch. The game is filled with truly bizarre creatures unlike any I've seen in a horror game. Think if Studio Ghibli decided to make a horror movie and you've got an idea of what the enemies are like. Honestly, I think the atmosphere is the main selling point since it's so strong and disturbing.\n\nThe problem comes with the game play. All of the monsters kill you in one hit without exception. You're usually transported to the last check point (statues that populate the town). It's usually only a few seconds of progress lost, but the thing is that the controls, while not bad, are simply not sharp enough for the scenarios the game places you in. Dodging monsters is nowhere near as responsive as it needs to be, and there are several sections throughout that lose their potency due to how many times you'll have to play them. Chapters 3 and 6 stand out in my mind as being the most problematic due to the mechanics of their respective bosses. And much of this comes from the fact that, for some unknowable reason, the closer you are to a monster, the faster your stamina drains. It's entirely counter productive. When you're not around any monsters, you can run for a good long time. When you're in the vicinity of a monster, it goes down pretty quickly, but you still have enough wiggle room to escape usually. When you're right near a monster, which happens very often, your stamina depletes in about a second and a half, yet there are several scenarios where you are forcedto dodge monsters that are faster than you. All of this is to say nothing about the \"story,\" which is fragmented at best and perfunctory at worst. I don't need everything spelled out for me, but things just kind of happen with no real rhyme or reason. It rarely feels like you're making any actual progress towards finding your sister, until the final chapter which just comes out of nowhere and doesn't offer any real sense of closure.\n\nAs an idea for where I stand on this game, I'd give it a 6.5/ 10. It truly is worth sticking through everything just to see the monsters and soak up the unique, nightmare esque atmosphere. I amlooking forward to the sequel, which at the time of this writing is only a few days away. I just hope the developers take notes on the many problems with the gameplay and story and manage to do their wonderful atmosphere justice in every facet of the next game. \n\nSo I do recommend it, but with a huge asterisk. That asterisk is you have to be able to put up with frustrating game design and an underwritten story.",

You can continually quick save around the map, but the only known way to save was going home, and for the longest time I didn't know how to get back in the house before the chapter ended.  In fact, I didn't think you could.  However, I found a forum post late game that showed me how, but at that point, it was virtually useless for me since I was already in the last chapter.

    "original_text": "It's a neat little game that combines cute and creepy. Developed by the same people who created Firefly Diary or htoL#NiQ, it let's you explore a town in the middle of the night where all the ghosts and spirits wander around. \n\nThe strength of the game is definitely the design of the ghosts and monsters. From stick figures, creepy woman to giant hairball spider, it's not lacking in enemy variety. You are allowed to explore the world although it does have a linear progression. I also really like the UI of the game. The map is a drawing of the little girl you are controlling and it's updated as you roam around the town. \n\nUnfortunately just like the devs' previous game, the weakness of the game is the difficulty and controls. Though the controls of this game are fine, the mechanics around it is flawed. Just like other horror games like Amnesia: The Dark Descent, there's no combat here and your only option is to run. They decided to add a stamina bar for running. The way it works though is that the closer the monster is to you, the faster the stamina drains. This factor alone makes the game more frustrating than it should be. Note that 1 hit from a monster is instant death. So you'll find yourself constantly getting killed just because the girl ran out of stamina. There is one particular part of the game where you have to be pixel-perfect in running away from a monster and I think I died a total of 10 times just because I didn't escape the hitbox of the monster by a hair.\n\nThe story is kind of sparse in this one so if you're looking for a good story, then you'll be disappointed. Most of the bits and pieces of the story is written from the collectibles that you get as you explore the town. Most of the post game is also about collecting stuff and finding extra side events.\n\nAll in all, I still recommend this game. If you're looking for a slightly creepy game and likes exploration in games, then you'll like it. Just beware of the frustrating gameplay mechanics.",

You can complete it in about 5-7 hours depending on your skill level with games like this.\n\nThe story is nothing to write home about. You're mostly looking for your dog and sister while what lurks in the shadows (literally, you can only see most monsters in the light of street lamps or your flashlight) hunt you down.\n\nThe gameplay loop is doing a set bit of story each night, wandering about the town and dodging lots of genuinely cool monsters. Monsters that aren't boss monsters you can kinda just end up running past with reckless abandon eventually, but boss monsters demand you respect their mechanics. At points the game does feel cheap with its deaths though, as the hitboxes of various enemies are genuinely atrocious, and some enemies either teleport or are very fast.\n\nPost game content is there, but it's nothing to write home about. You're mostly looking for items, some of which are behind rare monster events that will require you to keep resetting to your house to get. Tip though, once you do, save at a Jizo Statue as it keeps the event working in case you get killed. Also amass the maximum amount of salt, you'll thank me later for recommending this.\n\nWhy do I not recommend this game then? It has two sets of critical bugs that can literally make it unplayable. \n\nThe first bug is that it can just not open. It'll get to the loading screen before the title and then just simply close with no error put on the screen. The other one is that even if you don't resize the window, the game will freak out and think you did, giving an error then closing the game once you get to the same loading screen error. All suggested fixes I've seen on the Steam forums and beyond have not worked for me. What makes it weird is that the game did work fine once or twice, so the issue can appear at complete random.\n\nHowever, this game does work totally fine on my Steam Deck 512 GB LCD unit. I was able to play the game from start to end with zero issues. I've even been doing the play for fifty hours achievement on it, which admittedly is me just sitting in the protagonist's room, ha ha. That achievement counts ingame time by the way, not Steam hours time. It runs at 60 fps with no issues with sound, graphics, or the before mentioned crashing while maintaining at least three hours thirty minutes of battery life. I did not need to mess with my version of Proton to make it work.\n\nIf you do wanna get this game, get it on sale and don't be afraid to refund it. I'd honestly recommend getting it on another platform if you can, as it is a decent little adventure. The chance is very minimal, but I do hope one day this game gets fixes.",

Add to that the ambience and the enemy groans and snorts, and you're in for a creepy ride indeed.\n\nSecond is the visual design, and the art for this game is on par with the likes of Silent Hill or Zero/Fatal Frame.  A lot of the spirits are not downright menacing, but rather strange and curious, and it really captures the right feel for such ambiguous creatures.\n\nThe story is pretty minimalist as well, with a very basic outline that gets your character motivated to explore the night.

I think leaving the nature of the enemies a question was a good story decision.\n\nSo overall, I'd highly recommend this game if you're looking for something spooky and atmospheric.",

And it's not my system, there are numerous posts on the forums about it, go check for yourself.\nThat alone is bad enough, but it gets worse in combination with the save system. You can only save your progress at your house. There are several statues on the map where you can create a checkpoint to respawn at when you die, but they won't save your progress.\nSince the game crashes so much, you can choose between risking to lose hours worth of progress or going to your house every five minutes to save.\n\nAnother issue is all the \"boss fights\", which are mostly chasing sequences. They're often quite unfair and timed so tightly that you have no margin for error. For example, in one of those sequences you're being chased by a dead woman who can teleport in front of you and attack, in which case you're supposed to turn around and run the other way, but even if you anticipate it and yank your stick the other way immediately, she'll still get you 90% of the time. \nThen there are also lots of cheap and unavoidable deaths. You take the wrong path, a monster appears, you lose control over your character and die. The only way to avoid it is knowing it's there.\n\nAll this is exacerbated by the character's slow movement speed and checkpoints being literal miles away from those difficult sections. It sometimes takes you up to three minutes to walk back to where you died. That doesn't sound like much, you might say, but sit down and start counting seconds up to 180. And now imagine you have to retry a section five to ten times and have to walk back just as many times. That's up to 30 minutes of walking. And then your game crashes and it was all for naught.

Explore an empty and distinctly Japanese city while avoiding monsters which look like they crawled out of one of Miyazaki's nightmares. \n\nContact with a ghost will kill you instantly. Some people might find this frustrating after dying a bunch of times in the same location, personally I've found it to add to the tension.\n\nOn the other hand, there are a few cons. Keyboard controls are awkward. I'm four hours in, and I'm not really engaged in the main plotline. The puzzles I've encountered so far are limited to ''find object, place in obvious location''. You will die a lot, and many of those deaths are practically unavoidable, so there's a fair bit of trial and error. There are cutscenes here and there which try to play to your emotions, but they just come off as slow and irritating.\n\nThere are some mechanics which feel like they're tacked on - rocks for instance. I can throw a rock about a foot, I can't collect it after it's thrown, and most ghosts ignore them. The city is strewn with collectibles - bits of gum, old plastic camera - I guess those are thrown in to cater for completionists? \n\nApparently there are some side events I'll need to explore in more detail - little noteworthy encounters which you might find off the beaten track. It's a really cool idea, but these encounters seem pretty sparse. I think I've found one in four hours of play. I'd need to consult a walkthrough to have much of a chance to notice them, and to know what to do once I did.\n\nAll things considered, I would recommend this game to others. I really enjoy exploring this spooky Japanese town. It's a shame though, with better writing and a bit more polish it could have been spectacular.",

    "original_text": "I'm not exactly sure why people keep saying that this game is scary because it simply isn't. Apart from a few jump scares/ startling events in the beginning the game quickly becomes quite tedious and frustrating. The art style is too cutesy to make me feel creeped out and the mechanics used to avoid ghosts don't work as well as they should.\n\nEventually it just becomes a game that tests how effectively you can run around ghosts. Your sprint does not last long or even work as potently as it should meaning some ghosts can't be outrun. The rocks you use to distract? ghosts don't work as far as I've played in the game. You can't throw them far and the ghost don't seem to pay attention to them. The flashlight mechanic is interesting but, seeing that you can only point the light directly in front of you, causes you to have to run towards some ghosts in order to see where they are. Hiding also does not work on all ghost as some will simply wait for you to reveal yourself once again.\n\nThe storyline starts off well enough but quickly desolves into unanswered questions. You have a young girl who appears to be spending several nights alone, without parents, who is randomly searching for her sister; meaning she seems to pick the next area randomly without suspicion. She also appears to not realize that her dog died or that her sister was kidnapped, only knows that she is currently missing. While normally I believe that the unknown adds to the sense of horror in scary media I believe that it has to be done tactfully in order to be effective. I don't think Yomawari really does so. The game also has a tendency to corral you in the direction it wants you to go; which again takes away from this spooky feeling of the unknown.\n\nThe saving grace of this game that prevents it from being absolutely terrible are the interesting puzzles and of course kittens! but all in all I don't think this title is worth the 20$ and it's really hard to call it scary. It's really too simple to be interesting and spends too much time killing the player.\n\nIf you're looking for something similar I'd recommend Claire or Corpse Party.",

The only reason why my brother stopped playing and I stopped watching, was because the game kept freezing/crashing at the same spot, even when we tried all sorts of things to start the file over or restart the game/computer.

You play as a very young girl walking the streets of a small Japanese town, looking for her sister, who has gone out looking for their lost dog. The art style was this amazing dichotomy of cute/adorable and horrific. The fact that there was no way to fight the ghosts made them even scarier. All you could do was sneak, hide, and run. It made encounters extremely stressful. But despite the horrific elements, I found the game enchanting. The centipede demon was just a mesmerizing little bit of storytelling, as was the ghost wandering the cliffs. The ending, and the sacrifice the main character had to make, had me gasping because it was so shocking. It was all just really well crafted and wonderful, and very neatly wrapped up in a little 6-8 hour package. I adore short, concise games that have a clear story, tell that story, and then end.\n\nMy only real gripe with the game is the stamina bar, which is the main “battle” mechanic. The closer you are to a ghost, the more frightened you are, and the quicker the stamina bar decreases, which makes for some OBNOXIOUS chase sequences and boss battles when you’re just zig zagging and hiding to conserve the three seconds of stamina you get because you’re surrounded by ghosts. I died so frequently during the main sequences that it eventually became more of a “memorize the route” than a frightening ghost chase.\n\nI’d give Yomawari: Night Alone 8.5/10 and would absolutely recommend it to everyone.",

First, the game puts you on edge, and keeps you there for the duration of the game, the graphical style as a whole is also charming, I really like the designs of the spirits. The gameplay boils down to exploring the town, while learning about and evading the different types of spirits. Now, fair warning, you'll be dying a lot while trying to do this, and at times it can be frustrating, but in my opinion it's quite satisfying once you've figured things out. The story is fine, nothing to write home about but its a good excuse for an adventure. Overall a very solid horror game for about 4.5 hours, as long as the gameplay loop I've described doesn't sound awful to you.",

    "original_text": "I recommend this game but only for a very certian group what like creepy design and exploring and only if the game is cheaper. Overall its a ok game not bad or very good. But has many flaws that makes it not easy to recommend.\n\nFirst a VERY BIG WARNING about the saving mechanic. There are quick saves (inside the town after praying) and normal saves(at home). The quick saves are only check points not saves. If you leave the game without going back home(use map and teleport home) you will lose all your progress.

If you die you be teleport to your last check point or back home and keep all items you found. \n\nFor the story it's starts good but you can fast lose interest in it and most of the stuff you can tell what will happend already much earlier in the game.\n\nThere is not much music in this game but it has a good sound background.\n\nA good thing is that the map is much bigger then i expected and the design and atmosphere is great and creepy.\n\nThe spirit's inside the game have a very interesting design and there a lot of types some more command others can be found only on one spot.\n\nSaddly the game has a lot of cheap kills(you can't see your character behind some buildings and also get stuck on corners) and jump scars and this gets at some areas a bit annoying.\n\nBeside all this I had at the beginning a small bug in chapter 0/1 where the map will not load correctly and you see just a blank area.

That wouldn't normally be too awful in this day and age of constant, save anywhere games. But Yomawari isn't like that. In Yomawari you can quicksave at Jizo Statues, with coins. Jizo Statues act as automatic repawn points and you can warp to and from ones that you've unlocked. Any keys or items that you find persist between deaths, which is also great. Jizo Statue quicksaves however, are what I'll call a \"soft save\" and don't persist if, for example, the game crashes...which it likes to do frequently, and for no real reason.\n\nIt is really, REALLY inconvenient when it crashes, leading to you having to repeat content repeatedly if it keeps crashing before you can do a \"hard save\" which you can only seem to do from chapter to chapter, or in your house, which you can't always access. I had to do the section at the school 6 times because the game kept crashing. By the end I was so damn good at that section that I can pretty much speed run it from the house to the end in a few minutes, which is sad. \n\nThe repeated crashing ruins what is otherwise a pretty creepy and amazing game. The atmosphere and sound is out of this world. And the yokai designs are pretty creepy. This definitnely isn't one for people who aren't a fan of games where you die in one hit (Misao, Mad Father, Ao Oni), but it's still a great game. But the crashing, oh the crashing. Don't get this game if you're on Windows 10, unless you're extremely patient and willing to redo sections over sometimes because the developers don't seem intent on fixing the crashing problem. I've read the discussion forum and the reccommended fix was to switch to Windows 98 compatability mode, which did fix the crashing, but then the game ran at 15 fps and gave me a massive headache.\n\nTl;dr: Half a thumb up? \nGood game\nRepeated crashing leads to repeated frustration due to having to repeat content which leads to repetitiveness.\nBuy hesitantly.\n\nPS. Also not mentioned in the review but there seem to be this strange effect going on with the streets ingame which looks a bit like screen tearing? Is that intentional or just shoddy programming?",

    "original_text": "I expected this game to be about the contrast between the extremely cute and the horrific, but Yomawari does much more with it than just juxtaposition. It is, at every level, the journey of an innocent little girl, at the age where everything in drawn in crayons and you don't really understand anything about the world, through fear, pain, and death. It's not the darkest game out there, but it's definitely pretty damn grim for a game where you are a cute lil' girl.\n\n[u]Art style[/u]\nThe ghosts are really creative, and if you're into horror for of the grotesque and creative aesthetics, Yomawari delivers. Hallucinations are few and far between, but most creatures are a treat of Japanese horror.\n\n[u]Gameplay/horror[/u]\nYou know this problem horror games have when they're scary the first hours and it progressively de-escalates as you become familiar with the game? Yomawari is different. It's not really a survival game, in the sense that you're going to die, easily and a lot, but it's rarely very punishing. It is in essence a die-and-retry. But while it never really inspires dread, the gameplay makes it tense, consistently and until the end. The only thing you can do against the spirits is avoiding them. Stealth very rarely works, you have to zip past them. Only, the game gives you a limited stamina bar, which depletes faster and faster the closest you get to a ghost. What this means is that you generally have juuuuust enough time and stamina to dodge the spirits. It's actually pretty neatly calibrated, and it makes it so that basically you can never feel safe. Especially not with those nasty ghosts that come rushing at you for behind. You probably won't be scared, but you will be on edge.\n\n[u]Content[/u]\nThat's of course the weak spot of the game, a short four hours to finish the main story, with optional events and collectibles scattered across the map, with a free roam mode to get them all after the story ends.\n\nOverall, plenty to like if you like sad, tense games and J-horror aesthetics.",

But fun enough for adults as well.\n\nGylt is one of the best horror games I’ve played in years- not the scariest, but one of the most thoughtful. The level design and puzzles, the story (collect things!! Lots of story with collectibles!) it all comes together really well. Gylt was right up my alley: creepy, stealthy and somehow still kind of cute. The message is so strong... so many little details. It is just creepy enough to satisfy an adult and is suitable for a kid as well. Gylt plays like a lite version of many stealth and horror games wrapped in a theme of bullying. You play as a child called Sally who ends up in a twisted and surreal version of her town overrun with monsters while she's looking for missing cousin Emily. You sneak around monsters and distract with them tools like a flash-light or throwing soda cans. You explore well designed environments solving puzzles and finding collectibles that flesh out the story. The art style sorta reminds of that Coraline movie.\n\nIt plays like a kid friendly version of Resident Evil 2, not scary but spooky sometimes and definitely creepy. The main subject of the game (bullying) can also affect people deeply if you’ve suffered from it while younger (wich was my case to an extent). StillI highly appreciated how the theme of bullying is so incorporated. For example, I liked how the monsters' main attacks are pushing Sally and screeching at her (not sure how using the flashlight to stop them fits into the metaphor though). Or how the paintings, environments and diaries reflect how Emily has been bullied. It’s very good - but - half of the story is told through collectibles. They’re so important you can even go back into your game after beating it to continue collecting. Because it’s a short game, I’d definitely recommend trying to collect everything while playing it!\n\nI dislike that a lot of reviews say “Gylt is great but does nothing new.” It doesn’t need to do anything new. It’s offering a classic, masterful horror game experience in a package accessible to kids! It’s a good and short game (unlocking the last ending will take a bit of extra work though) with great visuals, and I highly recommend it.\n\n8/10",

The game puts too much emphasis on caring about what others say and do. The message is incorrect in how to handle bullying, as you do not find resolution by policing others or relying on their validation. There will always be those who are mean or even brutal. If you cannot handle this, then the problem is fixed by looking inward. Raising a little girl, I taught her to see her own value instead of caring about what mean kids said to her. I did not give her the idea that their words had weight that should be thought on. Her bully in first grade gave up bullying her, because it had no impact. Bullies are the way they are because they themselves are broken. No need to be broken along side. As such, this is not a good message in this game, as it puts way too much emphasis that hopelessness is without someone else lifting you up. Embracing sensitivity will only make the person more fragile to those who are mean. [/spoiler]\n\nIn all, the game is a lot of fun and cute.

    "original_text": "Babys first survival horror. Originally a Stadia exclusive, that got a second chance and for the most part it delivers. It's sort of a more kid friendly Alan Wake (mixed with some Silent Hill, if it was made by Tim Burton, where you explore a nightmarish version of your school, in search for your missing cousin. \n\nIt's a very forgiving and casual survival horror overall, you will never run out of batteries (your way to defeat enemies) or health since they are all over the place, the enemies will quickly lose interest in you if you run and hide and you will pretty much always have everything maxed and still have half a dozen more to pick up if things go south, and honestly it seldom does. The enemies are seldom a threat and you can dispatch or avoid them pretty easily. It's pretty much only the bosses that will give you any challenge at all, and even they are pretty easy when you understand the mechanics. This is not a bad thing, it's probably a very good first introduction to the genre, just don't expect to be challanged if you are a veteran.\n\nThe amount of collectibles in each area are also clearly marked, and if you are close enough they will be marked in the map. Just make sure you collect everything before the \"point of no return\", because the only good ending require that you have found and saved all \"Inhabitants\", otherwise you are given a choice between one depressing and one awful ending that are both pretty horrible, and kind of goes against the theme of the game. I kind of hate when games does that, when the \"secret\" ending is the true ending. But overall, a few missteps aside, Gylt is a pretty solid game. Happy that it got a second chance after Stadia.",

Yes the A.I knows where you are, but they have cues that will make them attack. Cues like running, your flashlight or if they actually see you. In other games you can be 50 ft away, dead still behind cover and they'll go \"I heard something\". That type of stealth isn't fun imo.\n\nCombat isn't bad. It would be better if she had a stick or something. I'd like to be able to jump. Without spoiling the game, why'd I do all of this to help, and I stay behind. The other option would be worse. \n\nThere's a camera transition that made me think I fell off the platform. And there's a unique camera angle that was fun once I realized I wasn't the enemy.\n\nThis is worth the money.",

At long last, following [b]Orcs Must Die 3[/b] (another Stadia exclusive that I didn't get to until much later), [b]Gylt[/b] has finally arrived on Steam. And it's pretty good!\n\nI tend to enjoy most stealth games, so perhaps I'm already the target audience for this type of thing. As usual in stealth games, your protagonist Sally can hide in shadows and distract enemies. Taking on many enemies at once is a bad idea. The enemy awareness meter, although simple, is sufficient. \n\nThe game has this cool Alan Wake-style light vs. dark thing going on, where Sally has a flashlight that she can focus to \"burn\" 2-3 particular spots on an enemy to dispatch them. She also has a \"flash\" that recharges over time that she can use to stun enemies. She can also jam the flashlight into the backs of most enemies to instantly destroy them. However, both her flashlight executions and flashlight focus eat a lot of battery power. Luckily, there are batteries absolutely everywhere, and the ones that you don't pick up are marked on your map. An odd aspect here is the game's insistence on telling you exactly what you can do with batteries (and inhalers) do every single time you pick them up. You'll get quite a bit of exposure to these tooltips.\n\nThe aforementioned inhalers heal Sally, and these are also all over the place (and marked on your map). I'm not even sure I can recall a time when I had less than four inhalers (Sally can carry a maximum of five). Although the batteries and inhalers could have introduced a bit of a survival horror aspect to the game, [b]Gylt[/b] just isn't difficult enough to create this tension in the player. What's odd here is that you later get a fire extinguisher that, although it requires time to recharge, never actually runs out of whatever compound is inside. This can be used not only to extinguish fires (duh), but can also help you solve puzzles, navigate through steam leaks, and freeze enemies!\n\nDon't get me wrong - there's still a lot to enjoy here. I thought the shadow version of Bethelwood and the school environments were compelling and lovingly crafted, and I enjoyed this \"Silent Hill 2 for kids\" vibe that the game had going on. The game is ostensibly about the bullying of Sally's little cousin Emily, and the enemies say amusing things like \"I smell loser!\" to drive this point home. Certain doors are also locked with these eyeball stalks that follow Sally around, which seem to echo Emily's feeling that everyone is always looking at her/judging her.\n\nAnother aspect of the game that I loved were the \"inhabitants.\" From time to time, Sally will locate a ball of something called \"blood quartz.\" She can use this blood quartz, one for one, to free individuals in the shadow town that have been turned to stone. These individuals have been trapped in the town, and upon their release Sally is rewarded with a diary entry that explains the circumstances that led to their gorgon-ification.\n\nUnfortunately, this brings me to the aspect of the game that I liked the least - the ending. Gylt is one of these games that features multiple endings. Whether you receive ending 1 or 2 depends only on what choice you make at the end, while ending 3 requires you to [spoiler]have located all 10 of the inhabitants and freed them. The issue here is that some of these inhabitants are quite well hidden. To find one in particular, you'll have to hit the button in an elevator to take you to a different floor, jump out before the doors close, and crouch beneath to fall into the elevator shaft! If I were to play the game upon release, when no guides had been written, there is no way that I would've located that inhabitant.\n\nEnding 3 allows both girls to leave. This means that I would be stuck with ending 1 or 2, which just seem unbelievably harsh to me. With these endings, only one of the girls is able to make it home, Sally or Emily. And the game strongly suggests that it should be Sally that stays. When Emily was bullied (prior to the events of the game), Sally was dismissive and didn't take up for her. Granted this is unfortunate, but is developer Tequila Works suggesting that this emotionally immature 11 year-old girl should be stranded in what is essentially Silent Hill as a result? An old man that helps both Sally & Emily comments, \"Sally, you know why you're here. Give Emily your ticket. Make things right.\" Make things right!? And as Emily leaves, Sally comments: \"I wish I'd been a better cousin.\" This is...uh...past tense, signifying that Sally may indeed be in dark Bethelwood for the long haul.[/spoiler]\n\nSo, I can recommend Gylt for the environments, puzzles, enemy designs and gameplay, but not for the fact that it implicitly suggests that [spoiler] an 11 year-old girl should be turned to stone and trapped in the shadow realm.[/spoiler] I had a much higher overall opinion of the game prior to the ending, but still came out of it with a net positive impression.",

Setting & Theme: The dark, gloomy autmosphere of the game really helped with the overall experience. It was well-made and did include details to express the theme of one's past and the expression of being bullied. As someone who has been bullied in school, and as someone who saw others get bullied, I felt a stab in my chest at some parts of the game, be it if I collected diary entries or if I watches the design of the game; Mean writings on the walls and the wooden dolls depicting acts of bullying. Still, having stuff such as fully functional soda machines did feel a little comical at times. 8.5/10 stars.\n\n2.Gameplay: While using inhalers to heal and fighting monsters with a flashlight and a fire extinguisher (which somehow freezes enemies solid) was a fun concept, the game felt pretty easy once you've gotten the option to really FIGHT back. Some elements that make horror games immersive and exciting is the risk of danger and death. It was pretty good at first, but after you've gotten the upgraded flashlight, you could just pretty much stand and fight most enemies with ease, barely even dodging or running away from them since they stumble after detroying each weakspot. While having the option to kill enemies isn't bad, it should come at a risk of sort (for example, if the flashlight were to overheat or consume more light, that would make players think twice before they just decide to kill everything). Without such risk, and with the game having no difficulty settings, it felt dull at times. Not to mention that stealth-killing an enemy consumes around 30% of your battery, while killing an enemy head-on - only about 5%. Don't bother sneaking around, since you can just kill most of them. Some of the boss fights were also, to be blunt, quite lame, especially the one at the auditorium. You could bath in that monster's light for 10 seconds before actually being in danger. If you've just finished Amnesia: The bunker on hard mode and are looking for a similar nightmarish, challenging gameplay experience, this game might not be for you. 6.5/10 stars. \n\nStory: I knew what I was getting to after reading the into message, but the story was pretty straight forward. Bullying has been around for many years now, be it in games or movies. The only real major twist that was experienced was the fact that Sally (the protagonist) was ALSO mean to Emily, at least by being ignorant. This is also something that you can only know if You've discovered the underground secret room. And speaking of secrets, discovering the diaries from the people who died down there explains some lore about the mining company and how people lost their mind while digging there. Even after reading all the diaries, I still have many questions as to how that parallel universe works? And how do the big bosses (who are named after emotions and feelings that one would experience while being bullied) change depending on the person? Sally wasn't the only one there, so how do the rest of the people see it? 7/10 stars.\n\n4. replayability and length: The game's length justified its price. With no difficulty settings, no post-story challenges and secrets, your depended on getting all collectibles in the game to play at your fullest. And while the game does have different endings, only one of them had a special condition of getting all the ticket pieces, which you can actually do even after completing the main storyline through an option in the main menu. Imagine if the game itself has choices that affected the ending, This could have made people actually replay the game just to find out how to get them (or at least how to make a video online guiding others). 7/10 stars.\n\nOverall, I would reccommand this game. I had fun with it, but after getting all collectibles and knowing there is nothing left after, I'll be moving on to the next title.",

    "original_text": "Survival horror is indeed a very tricky genre to make, although there are many games in this genre. The only game alongside GYLT, that I will call true survival horror is Outlast. That being said, this is a very well made survival horror game and even defeating enemies requires stealth and a lot of thinking. But, I would say, each success is very rewarding. The game involves a lot of thinking and strategy and the experience is made to be very realistic. You can relate to your character and strategize. What do I mean by that? Here's a small example without spoiling much. In the arcade section, as you try to get to the room with two billiards boards (this room is the only way to get to the second floor, where your objective is), you will have to face against two monsters. The problem is, if you face against one of the monsters, you will end up alerting another one, even before you can kill, at least, one of them. Facing off against two monsters simultaneously is never recommended. They gang up and you will not survive. Your best option is to distract them and crawl very noiselessly to the next room. I used a soda can to distract the monster to cross over behind one of the arcade game machine. But, there are gaps between rows and one of the monsters' visual field goes straight up the the opening, because he's standing facing the opening. The other monster is walking to and fro and he's the only one who can block monster 1's field of vision. Also, his visual field is not directly facing the opening in front of my character. But, you can clearly see his side profile. That means, his peripheral vision can see me partially. It will, at most, make him suspicious of my presence, unless I quickly hide behind another arcade machine. In simple words, you have to take a gamble. You must cross to the next row of arcade machine, as long as monster 2 is blocking the field of vision of monster 1, despite there being a chance that, he might get suspicious of your hiding spot and that's the gamble I took. In that area, there are three monsters in total. I could only kill the third one and that too using stealth mechanics. I can relate to the game and I can relate to it, because the game designer made it as realistic as possible. I played many survival horror/puzzle horror game with stealth mechanics. In most cases, I can never understand the game, because many a times, no - most of the times, the game logic does not relate to real life logic, which is sad, considering, most players are real life people who employ real life logic most of the time. The game is also very well executed. Most games gives excuse of \"I will not hold your hand\". What does holding my hand means? Does providing a bit of explanation of how your games works automatically translates to holding hands? That's so stupid. Holding hands means literally telling the player where to go and what to interact with throughout the whole length of the game. Explaining the game mechanics to the player very elaborately is not holding hands. If anything, it makes the gameplay very enjoyable for the players aka the clients of the developers. I do not think Overwhelmingly Positive reviews are hard to attain. Some developers are simply conscientious and others are not so conscientious. They never cared if their game is going to be entertaining. They only saw their customers as cashcow or their game is made for a selected or specific group of people. Overwhelmingly Positive games are made for everybody, so that everybody enjoys their time with the game.",

There's a section early where you have to hide from a boss who shines a spotlight looking for you. If it spots you, you have to hide as it slowly drains your health. That section felt really buggy, I wasn't even in the spotlight and it would just snap to me.

Though the story is painfully predictable to the point that Sally (the MC) almost seems a bit of a goof for not connecting the dots way earlier.\r\n\r\nIt's an easy enough game to run through in a few hours, though make sure you grab all of the collectibles before the end.  None of them can be missed, but they are tied to one of the game's three endings.  All of which you can see on a single playthrough, so this game is comfortably a one-and-done in terms of that.\r\n\r\nOverall?  A solid game.  Nothing fantastic, but far away from being bad.  It plays well, it looks alright, and the voice work is actually quite good!  It just falters at a few places, like the comic book cutscenes, the weird subplot that rather goes nowhere, and a fun, if disappointing, final boss.",

It's weird that you are unable to hold the flash light and a can of soda at the same time. The last time I checked a little girls had two hands. What's also weird is that this game was using 100% of my GPU and made the fans spin at max speed. I've never heard my GPU become so loud before with any other game.

It might spook you a bit for the first hour or so, but mercifully this is one of those modern horror games which don't try to scare you so much as unnerve you.

None of it's bad but none of it's particularly good, so most of your enjoyment will have to come from the story. which is actually pretty good. The game is on the shorter side so it doesn't need to parcel out its story sparsely, with frequent cutscenes that don't drag on beyond what's needed. You'll also be reading journal entries from various characters that further explain what's going on with your cousin and what's happening in the town.\n\nreplayability is low however, apart from a few collectibles and different endings there's not much to the game. As afformentioned the gameplay is not particularly enticing by itself, so you can expect to be done and through with this game in a single playthrough. Which will take you about 6-7 hours. The are no difficulty modes or new game plus modes and the endings can be selected at the end and thus dont require seperate playthroughs.\n\nSome advice for your playthrough however, the 3 different endings are good, bad and secret. The good ending is not particularly satisfying, so unless you're going to watch the other endings on youtube like me, i suggest you to carefully collect all the clay people collectibles. There's about 10 total in the game. Don't worry too much about getting everything in your first go as you can backtrack later and you'll get a warning before the final stretch begins.\n\nFinal rating: 7/10, its good but i'd wait for a sale unless the game really appeals to you.",

But no, not at all. \n\nThis game is more like the book series \"Scary stories to tell in the Dark\". Subject matter and visuals that are creepy and unsettling, but not so much that kids would be traumatized for days after. In other words, scary and serious enough that kids would be able to appreciate the thrill of fear the way adult horror media does for adults. \n\nAnd its brilliant. We need more movies and games like this.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, its again, approaching that level of survival horror that isn't too taxing but enough so that you can tell if you were careless you would feel it. Its what easy mode should be in any game; not a braindead mode, but a mode that you have to take seriously but can easily enough bounce back if you got sloppy. \n\nBut I will give one criticism to the gameplay. Due to the nature of the aim mechanic, being like og Resident Evil 4 with the laserpointer, the crosshair provided doesn't always line up to where the flashlight beam is aiming for combat or puzzle uses. With no option to turn off crosshairs, you just kinda have to learn to ignore it. Small thing, but still notable.  \n\nIn terms of story, I LOVE that it feels so much like Silent Hill. So much so, that this game could EASILY fit in the Silent Hill universe with very VERY minimal changes to background lore that doesn't even need to be found. Unless you want the best ending.\n\nThumbs WAY up on this one.",

It feels like a good mixture of Little Nightmares, Alan Wake and Stray.\n\nThere's just one thing i didn't like at all: To get the good ending you have to find a lot of optional collectibles which is a bit frustrating, especially since the game doesn't give you a warning and the chance to say \"no, i still have things to do\" when the last mission starts. But you can get back to the campus in freeroam mode after finishing the game, collect the missing items and finish the game again to get the good ending (that's how i did it). But i still think this isn't a prime example of good game design since the game doesn't warn you and getting the collectibles requires a lot of backtracking an possibly a guide to find some of the better hidden items.\n\nBut overall i'd say: Really good game!
